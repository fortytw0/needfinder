56	In my class, there was a classmate...he liked playing games, and liked making videos of game playing and uploading them. When I saw it, I thought it was fun, so I started to do it...I will do it together with him, and it is good for us to do it together.	She was born in 2000 (and I was born in 1999)... although we go to school together and we are in the same graduate class... she will talk about the post-2000 generation’s romantic ideas. Things like that will usually receive a high number of views	They will say, will it interfere with your studies? I say,‘This is [for] my major. This is for me to do practice with the media, otherwise how can I know the media ecology?	neither	neither
59	It can make people better aware [that] the wheelchair is coming, but I don’t want to draw extra attention on me, especially on my disability	Sometimes I can ask a person to volunteer to clear the way when I’m coming, or I can make a sound like..’zzzz’ , so people will turn their head back and see me coming.	You don’t have tactile feedback in these wheelchairs, whereas if you were in a manual chair, You know, you can feel the resistance when you’re trying to push it	q0_more_similar	q0_more_similar

62	It is not so interesting if you just go out to play for two days and shoot. Because if I am just a passerby, I will not fnd it attractive. Because it is just your life, not mine. I think, as uploaders, we have the responsibility to present quality content to the audience. I will not just make day-to-day accounts, because not every moment of life is fun	If you want to be an uploader, you want to make sure it is high quality. Otherwise, it is a waste of others’ time, which is not good	The number of views of my video got plummet all of a sudden, and there was not much exposure then. It was at that time that I realized that, oh, video uploading was not something that you do randomly, that you just edit and upload it	q0_more_similar	q0_more_similar
64	It was a long time ago, last year, when I uploaded a ftness video...Probably it happened to step on the recommendation algorithm, and it got over 500,000 views shortly, but it did not bring many followers...and the interaction was also not good.	For me to make the Vlog, frst it is to share my life, and second, I hope it can also help others.”	Some fans told me in their private message that they got dates by following my tutorials...I felt it was worth it. Even if the video was only watched by a number of viewers, it was worth it. I was very happy. It was the highlight and gave me a sense of achievement.	q1_more_similar	neither
65	It was easier to go back through the timeline when I could understand the story and empathize with others only if I knew the story covered earlier	I could jump back to certain sections by looking at snapshots on the timeline when there was something I couldn’t understand	I was able to enjoy the stream by looking at the parts that people were mainly interested in.	q0_more_similar	q0_more_similar
66	It was nice to see useful chat messages being organized without unrelated ones and keep them like memos	I could understand the flow of the game well because it made the order of previous events clear for me.

67	It’s not professional, so when joining a new team, it seems inappropriate to use gifs/stickers when others do not. If I work with this team longer, I’m sure I will start using them once I know everyone well	I use Microsoft teams which doesn’t support most of gifs	I’m very less familiar with these emojis infact till today also I don’t know the actual need of some emojis	neither	neither
69	I’m not sure who’s signing, I’m not sure who’s talking	I don’t know if they’ve raised their hand or where they are. Sometimes I can’t see them and it’ll be like, oh, they’re on a diferent screen	when there are more people in the room we can’t all fit in one screen and so you have to swipe screens to get the view of the other people and that is a signifcant problem	both	both
7	For example, here, in their videos, ...there is a change in audience feedback, e.g. there is a lot of Danmu, and I will know that the feedback is good, and I will know this is the efect that I should learn.	If you watch a video several times, you would learn how they edit it, and you can try to imitate it for that effect. Overtime, you will know.	You are all alone by yourself, speaking to yourself in front of a camera, with emotions, and then, editing is also a very long process. You might sit there for a whole day, and quietly watch an episode again and again, by yourself, and there is nothing to talk about, and there is no input from anyone else either. There is a lot of tedious labor, all manual labor.	q0_more_similar	q0_more_similar
70	I’m pretty good at driving the wheelchair and perceive the available space...If I say go through that gap, the technology should be making sure that I’m going through that gap and doing the avoidance, but not slowing down to crawl.	Full autonomy will allow me to focus on other things. For example, say take me to platform H, it will take me automatically there while I can focus on chatting with my friend.	It is a superb design! Clearly, it would enable more people to drive, because it’s not excluding you on the basis of an inability to drive	q1_more_similar	q0_more_similar
71	I’m very less familiar with these emojis infact till today also I don’t know the actual need of some emojis	It’s not professional, so when joining a new team, it seems inappropriate to use gifs/stickers when others do not. If I work with this team longer, I’m sure I will start using them once I know everyone well	You don’t really know these people, and so you want to give of the right meaning of the message. Since we work remotely, what makes sense to you may not for them... especially since I was new, they did not know my personality	neither	neither
73	Making videos is fun for sure, but I am thinking, it is not necessary to be an uploader if you just want to ordinarily share your life. But that is just mediocre. Since you’ve determined to do it, you should become stronger and bigger.	For future development, probably I will become fulltime one day, but currently I am no way, no way near there, and I have to look for a job. I have a vision for sure, but I do not know how to land it, and we will see how I develop	I got a certifcate when I had 6,000 fans... They were saying if you reached over 5,000 fans and if you could update how many videos how often...I forgot the concrete numbers...you would obtain a certifcate.	q0_more_similar	q0_more_similar
74	Most people, people in my team, are above 50 or 60, so it’s a little difcult to send like meme, stickers it can mean like something diferent if you are not sending to the people of your own age...Because I did not like I uh I did not get any response back, so I thought, okay, so maybe I should not have sent that; otherwise, she would have been responded to me...it’s a generational gap.	I would say, for using stickers and memes, they are fun, but I don’t use those with like everyone basically I use these GIFs and stickers approximately with only like four to fve people...I keep my professional distance...if you would say because nobody uses those I have back in India, so I am on the fence with that	The very frst time, I couldn’t use all this because I was not aware Like if it was actually a good thing to do so, even with the manager, I still can’t do it... though things are smooth and all but I still can’t do it or use emoji while chatting with my manager or some other person in the senior management, it is just that we use simple SMILEY	both	both
75	My team lead posts some kind of random joke every day on like one the platform, so what he did was like he posts a joke there, and he would add random emoji at the bottom with the post, and would want us to vote using those emoji	Then slowly, then, after some time we transcended from emails to phone calls and then to video calls like four ... And that happened because I would sometimes use SMILEY or some emoji and they would also reciprocate	There is an emoji that’s kind of like that this guy used to send to everybody, and it became kind of like his thing...And then now do you know we don’t see that emoji thrown around anymore, and feel like people don’t want to use it, because then you know; it’s copycatting that guy	neither	q1_more_similar
76	One of the reasons I don’t play [movement-based games] is it involves a lot of set up depending on what game you want to play.	The reason I don’t do it physical activity is because I’m on my own, my carer comes in the morning and the night and I’m with my fiancée or whatever most of the day so to get into the pool and get changed to exercise you need someone there, so I like to be as independent as possible and that’s probably why I don’t exercise and do that stuff in my own time. [...] With gaming I can just have my PC set up on sleep and roll up to it and use it and we are good to go	if the building has accessibility but it requires someone to operate the lift for you, you don’t feel very independent, you don’t want to feel as if people are going out of their way	q0_more_similar	q0_more_similar
78	So he would say thank you over the video, and after a few minutes he would send a giphy...he would send that, and that sticker would be crying. And it would seem that that person is sad, and I wouldn’t say anything like for a few days, but then I noticed this kept happening again. I was totally clueless...and then it turns out that he was sending like over happiness, which I thought, like, ‘Why is he crying and why is the person sad?	I actually mostly have that problem with the thumbs up analogy because, like, in my family like if I use that with my mom she would think I was really passive aggressive and like vice versa, my mom used that with me and actually the frst time, my supervisor used it, I thought she was mad at me, and then I realized that was her version	Yeah, I mean one thing is that there are too many emoji and I have to if I had to use a new one, I had to go and search what it means, and then use it. So most of the times, I’m aware that there is a hover over feature, it tells the meaning, but it’s just that there are too many. So, I think it’s just a preference that I tend to not look over it since, as I mean since I’m a Ph.D. student, I tend to have a short amount of time to get things done in a short amount of time	q0_more_similar	q0_more_similar
79	So in Tell-Tale games, they say at the end of the chapter ’66 percent of people made this decision’, and you can compare yourself so if you’re climbing Everest you can give them options to go this way, or tie yourself to this tree, so this influences PA that the person does [...].	I don’t like getting called out. There can be a lot of rage like you can make a mistake and die first [...] and people might not know you’re disabled, like you die on an easy part where everyone lived. [...] I don’t want to have to explain myself	Like Facebook games...it will come up on your feed showing you how well others have done, giving people a challenge, like global challenges so that’s involving others, but it doesn’t really affect you	q1_more_similar	q1_more_similar

83	Sometimes the system don’t realize that you have perceived an issue and they will do something that you think is irresponsible..For example, you could have a collision avoidance system that is doing the best to avoid you running into a wall, but actually you are trying to get closer to the wall because you are trying to avoid a child running on the pavement	In the crowds, it is most likely the wheelchair will keep changing its direction to avoid people, which is the least thing I would want to have..It can be confusing and uncomfortable..	When the wheelchair does something out of my intention and that causes unhappiness for other people, I don’t want people to think it is what I intend to do and I’m a bad guy.	both	q1_more_similar

87	The number of viewers soon reached over 10,000, and it was so much higher than what I imagined. I imagined it could be, could be tens of people to watch.	I tried Douyin but gave it up.

91	The system let me know roughly what happened before, but some keywords were too general so it was hard to know what happened exactly	Based on snapshots and keywords I was able to roughly understand when ingredients were introduced and when and what ingredients were added.
