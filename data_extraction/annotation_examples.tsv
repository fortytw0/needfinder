There can be a lot of rage like you can make a mistake and die first [...] and people might not know you’re disabled, like you die on an easy part where everyone lived. [...] I don’t want to have to explain myself	the main problem is like most wheelchair users in England, they’re told by doctors [...] this is kind of the end, like once you’re in a wheelchair that’s sort of the of it [physical activity] [...] so it’s difficult to find a large enough group	So in Tell-Tale games, they say at the end of the chapter ’66 percent of people made this decision’, and you can compare yourself so if you’re climbing Everest you can give them options to go this way, or tie yourself to this tree, so this influences PA that the person does [...].

For messages with a wider audience, they served as a quick way to express agreement, looking into something or give a quick response to indicate that attention has been given to a message someone has put out	“To make the conversation a little lighter and to indicate if something is funny or hilarious	It helps to communicate emotion and create more meaningful connections with your team. It gives the conversation a more human and connected feel
107	70	1	False	Yeah, I mean one thing is that there are too many emoji and I have to if I had to use a new one, I had to go and search what it means, and then use it. So most of the times, I’m aware that there is a hover over feature, it tells the meaning, but it’s just that there are too many. So, I think it’s just a preference that I tend to not look over it since, as I mean since I’m a Ph.D. student, I tend to have a short amount of time to get things done in a short amount of time	So he would say thank you over the video, and after a few minutes he would send a giphy...he would send that, and that sticker would be crying.

I was totally clueless...and then it turns out that he was sending like over happiness, which I thought, like, ‘Why is he crying and why is the person sad?	I actually mostly have that problem with the thumbs up analogy because, like, in my family like if I use that with my mom she would think I was really passive aggressive and like vice versa, my mom used that with me and actually the frst time, my supervisor used it, I thought she was mad at me, and then I realized that was her version	Yeah, I mean one thing is that there are too many emoji and I have to if I had to use a new one, I had to go and search what it means, and then use it. So most of the times, I’m aware that there is a hover over feature, it tells the meaning, but it’s just that there are too many. So, I think it’s just a preference that I tend to not look over it since, as I mean since I’m a Ph.D. student, I tend to have a short amount of time to get things done in a short amount of time

144	75	1	True	with this [Scavengers] you are doing the exercises because it is a fun thing to do. Also, the actions you are doing seem more relevant to what’s going on on the screen.	you don’t think about doing these activities when you’re playing the game like collecting these pizzas or fighting robots, so it becomes one more robot, one more robot, and you don’t even realise you’ve done PA	game is there for me to escape and forget what I’m doing [...] it allows me not to be reminded of what I look like
70	76	1	False	I’m pretty good at driving the wheelchair and perceive the available space...If I say go through that gap, the technology should be making sure that I’m going through that gap and doing the avoidance, but not slowing down to crawl.	Full autonomy will allow me to focus on other things. For example, say take me to platform H, it will take me automatically there while I can focus on chatting with my friend.	It is a superb design! Clearly, it would enable more people to drive, because it’s not excluding you on the basis of an inability to drive

I couldn’t really find a good resource for that	It took a lot more attention to detail because of food safety.

76	81	1	False	One of the reasons I don’t play [movement-based games] is it involves a lot of set up depending on what game you want to play.	The reason I don’t do it physical activity is because I’m on my own, my carer comes in the morning and the night and I’m with my fiancée or whatever most of the day so to get into the pool and get changed to exercise you need someone there, so I like to be as independent as possible and that’s probably why I don’t exercise and do that stuff in my own time.

Because it really took me quite some eforts, but I made a...a fatal mistake. That is, I was too self-absorbed. I neither considered it from the audience’s perspective, nor paid attention to whether they could understand.	It is not so interesting if you just go out to play for two days and shoot.
