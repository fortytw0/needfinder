23	69	1	TRUE	Neha	I feel that they help convey emotion and provide context in text conversations, where feelings are not as easily expressed as in video calls. After a while on the team, it was also a means of having a laugh or adding favor to casual conversations and getting to know one another. For messages with a wider audience, they served as a quick way to express agreement, looking into something or give a quick response to indicate that attention has been given to a message someone has put out	“To make the conversation a little lighter and to indicate if something is funny or hilarious	Both equally similar	It helps to communicate emotion and create more meaningful connections with your team.

And slowly you will fnd that the issues they want to talk about or the things they care about have all been covered... In a video, one uploader said, ‘I am done telling you all my opinions about fashion, and I don’t need to output more’... So I feel their updating is slowing down...

I neither considered it from the audience’s perspective, nor paid attention to whether they could understand.	Both equally similar	It is not so interesting if you just go out to play for two days and shoot. Because if I am just a passerby, I will not fnd it attractive. Because it is just your life, not mine.
