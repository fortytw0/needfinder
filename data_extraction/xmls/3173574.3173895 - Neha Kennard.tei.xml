<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Emotion-and stressed-related eating (ESRE) is associated with weight management difficulties and is more likely to affect women than men. Additionally, health information technology (HIT) for weight management tends to be less effective for women than it is for men, and less effective for people who engage in ESRE. Therefore, this study explores how HIT can support overweight/obese women curb ESRE behavior. Study participants, all adult overweight/obese women (BMI ≥ 25), logged dietary intake for 10 days with the Lose It! smartphone app as an elicitation exercise. Cross sectional, semi-structured interviews (N = 22) were then conducted to explore technology support needs concerning ESRE behavior. Findings revealed participants had the following needs: holistic health goal development, building motivation to achieve goals, and assistance with handling stress. Resulting HIT guidelines include supporting holistic health goals, developing and sustaining motivation, exchange of emotional support, understanding of behavior, and change in ESRE mindset.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Research indicates a link between emotion-and stressrelated eating (ESRE) and difficulty with weight management over time. Obese (BMI ≥ 30) people who lost weight only to regain it over time have reported a tendency to cope with negative emotions by eating food <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. Other studies have found that 1-2 years after a behavioral weight loss program, higher levels of ESRE were significantly associated with less sustained weight loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">61]</ref>. Additionally, women have a greater tendency to engage in ESRE than men <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. Moreover, women largely demonstrate emotional eating in context of negative affect [e.g., 7], whereas men are inclined to eat more in response to positive emotions than women [e.g. <ref type="bibr">, 32]</ref>. Altogether this suggests the relationship between overweight/obesity and ESRE in women is of a magnitude and quality distinct from men. Furthermore, there is wide variability in individual responses to behavioral weight-loss interventions; as such, we need to understand the factors that underlie such variability so that effective interventions can be developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[33]</ref>. ESRE may help to explain differential response to health information technology (HIT) interventions; for this reason, we investigate HIT design in context of this behavioral pattern.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RELATED WORK</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations of HIT Weight Loss Interventions</head><p>While most digital weight loss-based interventions incorporate self-monitoring and goal-setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">50]</ref>, these strategies may be less effective for people who engage in ESRE <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[40]</ref>, which is more common in women <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. Relatedly, HIT weight loss interventions are more effective in men than women <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">59]</ref>, and men adhere more closely to self-monitoring interventions than women <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20]</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, we argue that attention to ESRE is critical for developing more effective digital weight management interventions, and especially for women. This is particularly important given that women are the largest users of weight loss products <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">56]</ref>. Therefore, we explore potential reasons for the aforementioned differential adherence and effectiveness of self-monitoring and goal setting interventions in women who engage in ESRE. We thus ask the following research question: RQ 1: What issues do overweight/obese women who engage in ESRE experience in using existing selfmonitoring and goal-setting-based HIT focused on weight management?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ESRE-related HIT Studies</head><p>Few studies have looked at using HIT to address ESRE among people who do not have a diagnosed eating disorder. Bauer, de Niet, Timman, &amp; Kordy found that following a cognitive behavioral treatment program, text message reporting of eating behavior, physical activity behavior, and emotions (i.e., answer to "How often have you felt sad or unhappy last week?") with follow-up tailored feedback was marginally effective for overweight children attempting to lose weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>. Additionally, Mattila et al. developed and studied a calendar-based mobile app that allowed users to track and self-monitor wellness measures including diet and emotional state <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[37]</ref>; the focus of the research, however, was primarily mobile app usage and acceptance, and did not deeply investigate the role that HIT played in managing ESRE for weight management. Other research has investigated behavioral interventions that include stimulus control strategies for eating behavior that is based on a number of triggers including "emotion" <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[31]</ref>; this line of research is encouraging, but still emerging.</p><p>A few studies have explicitly addressed ESRE through HIT. Manzoni et al. provided relaxation training to a group of women with some research participants using a traditional imagination condition and others using a virtual reality condition to support relaxation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[35]</ref>. While both groups lost about the same amount of weight, ESRE episodes were reduced more among women in the virtual reality condition.</p><p>Although it is a preliminary study, it highlights the potential for using newer technology to address ESRE and weight management. Additionally, other exploratory research was conducted on HIT interventions that look specifically at eating binge-trigger connections in relation to clinical eating disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref>. It is unclear, however, the extent to which this research is applicable to nonclinical populations, which are the focus of this study. For instance, users find it burdensome to enter dietary intake into food tracking apps [e.g., 16], and therefore stop engaging with them. Additionally, some research has found that users stop logging over time because they experience life events that start to take precedence, or initial forgetfulness about entering data snowballs into complete abandonment because users take the view that missing data renders the log wholly inaccurate <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. While such short-term usage may undermine effectiveness for all types of users, it may be especially problematic for ESRE, which is typically a longterm behavioral pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">27]</ref>; effective HIT to address this issue may require engagement over the long term to adequately address underlying reasons behind the behavior.</p><p>Additionally, overweight/obese women who engage in ESRE need to address not only weight loss, but also the stress and negative affect they experience, and their subsequent eating as a coping response. Currently, with some exceptions (e.g., Clue Period Tracker), HIT available in the consumer market separately deals with emotions, behaviors, and physiological measures, thereby failing to address the interconnectedness of many of these measures in a health context. It is therefore important to investigate whether existing HIT is appropriately designed for the many concerns of overweight/obese women who engage in ESRE. Thus we investigate the following research question:</p><p>RQ 3: How can HIT for weight management be designed to address ESRE in overweight/obese women?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p>After 10 days of using a popular weight loss application, cross sectional, semi-structured interviews (N = 22) were conducted to explore the experiences of overweight/obese adult women who engage in ESRE. Participants also completed surveys regarding their demographics and psychosocial characteristics. The study was approved by the University of Michigan IRB-Health Sciences and Behavioral Sciences (HUM00110332).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sampling, Recruitment, and Screening</head><p>The study used a purposive sampling method (maximum variation) to achieve representation across race/ethnicity, age, educational attainment, and overweight/obesity severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[45]</ref>. Study participants were recruited through word of mouth, email lists associated with a large Midwestern university and its hospital system, as well as through flyers distributed at conferences and businesses in a Midwestern metropolitan area. Potential participants completed a screening questionnaire. Eligible participants were women age 25 or older with the following characteristics: overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25), no eating disorder diagnosis, owned and used an iPhone or Android smartphone, and weight management experience. Additionally, to be eligible, potential participants had to report in the screening questionnaire a concern that their overeating food when feeling stress or other negative emotions was negatively affecting their health; this ensured that participants were aware of their ESRE, so as to facilitate reflection sought in interviews. Interview sample size resulted from ending interviews upon saturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection</head><p>Participants were asked to complete a ~15-minute survey that captured demographic and psychosocial data. The survey measured ESRE via the 4-item version of the Coping subscale of the Palatable Eating Motives Scale (PEMS), which measures the frequency of coping with negative situations by consuming tasty food/drink (e.g., chocolate, fries, soda, etc.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>. The PEMS score was the mean of the four subscale responses, resulting in a possible PEMS score range of 1-5; higher scores indicate higher frequency of coping through palatable eating.</p><p>Participants were asked to use the free version of the Lose It! smartphone app to track their dietary (food and drink) intake for 10 days, which also required that they set a weight loss goal in the app. Although all participants had weight management experience, and could potentially comment on other experiences with digital weight management tools, participants were asked to use Lose It! as an elicitation exercise to stimulate reflection about a digital intervention that could be compared across participants, and to ensure participants could readily discuss recent experiences with a digital intervention in interviews.</p><p>Lose It! was selected for the elicitation exercise because it is a smartphone app available on both iPhone and Android platforms, it is a popular smartphone app as indicated by its listing as one of the "Top Free iPhone Apps" and "Top Grossing iPhone Apps" for the Health &amp; Fitness category in the Apple App Store <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref>, and it supports the tracking of weight and dietary intake through its free version. Additionally, it allowed a researcher account to connect to participant user accounts (with participant permission) to view food entries and communicate via in-app messaging.</p><p>Participants were told that in the interview they would be asked about their experiences tracking dietary intake with Lose It!. Additionally, participants were told that while they were expected to log all of their food and drink for the 10 days, but if for some reason they did not input data for a meal or an entire day, it was more beneficial for the study that they share why they did not log items rather than fabricate data to appear as though they were consistent in their tracking.</p><p>At the time of data collection (September 2016-April 2017), the free version of Lose It! supported daily food, physical activity, and weight tracking that could be accessed on mobile and desktop devices (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Lose It! allowed users to set their own weight goal and the rate at which they would like to lose weight on a weekly basis (e.g., 1 lb. per week, 1.5 lbs. per week, etc.). Based on those entries, Lose It! calculated a daily calorie budget that served as the user's daily caloric goal.</p><p>Users entered dietary intake (food, drink) by either manually entering food item and calories, using prepopulated food items from the Lose It! database, using food items a list of their previously entered food items, scanning the food item barcode, or by taking a picture of the food item for the app to automatically identify. When users entered food, the Lose It! food log screen displayed calories consumed, and calories still available (in green) for the day or calories the user had exceeded (in red) beyond the daily calorie budget (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Users could also view a macronutrient information screen for each food item they entered.</p><p>At the end of each day, Lose It! sent a message that stated the date by which they would make their goal weight if they continued to eat the same as they ate on that day. Additionally, Lose It! sent other messages that included encouragement for users to track food, as well as general, positive messages (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Weight was entered in either manually by users or automatically uploaded from a wireless scale. Weight was entered at the user's discretion; this could be done on a daily basis or less frequently if the user desired. Weight changes were reflected on a weight loss graph screen. Physical activity was either manually entered by users or automatically updated from fitness trackers. Users could earn an upward adjustment in daily food calories by engaging in physical activity.</p><p>Lose It! tracked goals related to weight and physical activity (steps and exercise calories). Lose It! did not provide opportunities to track eating behavior (aside from dietary intake), emotions, or physiological sensations related to hunger.</p><p>Participants had a 60-90-minute unstructured interview that took place within 2-3 days of completing 10 consecutive days of Lose It! tracking. The interview included general questions related to ESRE, questions about use of Lose It! and previous experiences using smartphone apps for weight management, and questions tailored to participants' survey responses. At the end of study participation, participants received an incentive payment of $50.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim, then analyzed with the aid of MAXQDA12 coding software. An initial deductive codebook was developed and then added to throughout the coding process on an inductive basis. Deductively, literature related to ESRE, as well as pilot study interview responses, served as the conceptual starting point of the codebook used for Provisional Coding <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>; inductively, new codes were added to the codebook as they emerged through line-by-line coding <ref type="bibr">[49]</ref>. Following first cycle coding, Pattern Coding was used in the second cycle to group codes into themes <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[38]</ref>.</p><p>Throughout analyses, steps were taken to address potential threats to validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[51]</ref>. Peer debriefing was used to ensure that data collection was accurate and complete <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[55]</ref>. Participant responses were triangulated with food logs, surveys, interview questions, and follow up probes to mitigate observer effects. A reflexive journal was maintained and referred to by the lead author to preserve neutrality <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[43]</ref>.</p><p>In practical terms, this meant recording and referring back to personal thoughts and reactions to the data as it was analyzed. This process allowed for feelings and opinions about the data to be acknowledged, thereby ensuring that data was analyzed in a neutral manner. Finally, to address reliability, a second coder used the codebook to code five randomly selected interviews to compare with the lead author's coding. A comparison of the two sets of coding resulted in a Cohen's Kappa statistic of .72, indicating substantial agreement <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[57]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINDINGS Participant Characteristics</head><p>On average, participants were just under 36 years of age and were obese with a BMI slightly greater than 35. Half of the participants were either African American (27.3%) or Latina (22.7%), whereas 45.5% were White. Almost ¾ of participants either had an undergraduate college degree (27.3%) or graduate degree (50%). Additionally, just under three-fourths (72.7%) of participants had experience using a smartphone app to track weight, diet, or physical activity prior to participating in the research. Furthermore, on average, half of the time that participants consumed tasty food/drink, they did so for emotional reasons (e.g., to forget worries, to cheer up) (PEMS: M = 3.12; SD = 1.07). Self-tracking data showed that 20 (91%) of participants logged their food for 8 or more days in the Lose It! smartphone app. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">N = 22 M (SD) N Age (</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of Findings</head><p>Study participants' descriptions of their ESRE needs and issues related to using HIT for weight management is organized by three primary themes. 1) Holistic Health Goals: Participants defined their health goals in holistic terms and desired HIT that supported their broad vision. 2) Motivation to Achieve Eating Behavior Goals: Participants experienced challenges in sparking motivation and inspiring initial steps to change their eating behavior; however, participants identified and, with some exceptions, generally found HITmediated support to be helpful in sustaining existing motivation. 3) Handling Stress: To reduce reliance on ESRE as a coping response to stress, participants needed to eat with awareness, safeguard against ESRE through emotional support and HIT-generated encouragement, and understand ESRE behavior and adjust their related mindsets to sustain behavior change over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Holistic Health Goals</head><p>Participants viewed their health goals in holistic terms; they wanted HIT that was designed in alignment with how they wanted to measure their weight management progress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Health Defined in Holistic Terms</head><p>Overall, participants had the goal of achieving and maintaining good health, which was not wholly tied to weight loss, but more broadly conceptualized as "mental, physical, and emotional health" (P19). As one participant elaborated, "Eating in proportion. Exercising on a fairly regular basis. Having a balanced emotional life, where you have time for your friends, time for yourself, time for your partner…that would be the ideal healthy life." (P20) Notably, not a single interview participant defined good health solely in terms of a specific weight. One participant noted, "Skinnier is not necessarily better. Healthy is what is better." (P18) Even when explicitly discussing weight loss, the physical body tended to be referenced in terms of ability (e.g., energy, stamina) instead of body weight or size. For instance, one participant described the catalyst for her most recent weight loss effort as follows: "It was me going, 'My joints hurt. And I know that I need to be in a better place…' without a real goal, just a, 'My knees need to not crunch as much.'" (P7) Despite a strong desire to focus on overall health, some participants reported struggling with de-emphasizing the importance of weight. One participant shared that as much as she wanted to have a broader view of health, it was difficult: "I don't want to structure my desire to be healthy as a desire to lose weight…I want to love myself and better myself…[That's] hard to do." (P5) Some participants took active measures to reduce the significance they placed on weight. As one participant reported: "I refuse to keep a scale at home…it would become an obsession every day. I could easily see that happening if I kept a scale…I don't want to do that to myself." (P8)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIT and Holistic Health Goals</head><p>Participants expressed the importance of holistic conceptualization of goals to be accounted for in HIT designed to support weight loss. To begin, this meant not necessarily emphasizing weight. This was partly because weight-related goals in themselves could provoke negative feelings. For example, a number of participants (n = 4) reported actively avoiding a scale as much as possible to protect themselves from the negative feelings associated with knowing their weight in quantified terms.</p><p>Instead of a sole focus on weight, participants advocated a wider range of options for goal identification in HIT that extended beyond weight tracking. Many participants wanted systems to emphasize process-oriented goals related to behavior change rather than the outcome of weight loss. For example, several liked it when HIT (Lose It! and other smartphone apps) acknowledged via a message or badge that they were successful in implementing a healthy habit such as logging dietary intake for a particular number of days, drinking a certain amount of water in a day, or exercising consistently over a certain time period. One participant noted that an HIT emphasis on habit implementation rather than weight loss was important because she had control over her behavior but not the physiological process of weight loss: "I don't determine my weight loss. I determine my habits and my habits determine my weight loss." (P1) Some participants wanted an emphasis on broader life goals that could be facilitated through weight loss. One participant suggested that HIT provide opportunities for users to post goal activities that would be possible after losing weight (e.g., meeting the weight limit to go horseback riding) rather than weight alone. As she noted, "A goal like that is more something that I would like than a number." (P13)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motivation to Achieve Eating Behavior Goals</head><p>Participants were challenged in cultivating and sustaining motivation to meet their health goals. They generally found HIT-mediated support to be a positive influence on their motivation if they already had some motivation, though some participants disliked some approaches. HIT did not, however, help with building motivation that was not already there.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cultivating and Sustaining Motivation</head><p>Participants reported varying levels of motivation related to changing and sustaining healthy eating behaviors. Despite widespread acknowledgement that food was not an effective coping tool, many participants struggled with a lack of motivation. Moreover, they were unsure of how to get themselves to the preliminary step of wanting to make behavior changes. A number of participants suggested that they likely would make changes in eating behavior only if their health was in perceptibly immediate peril as a result of it. One participant stated that she would probably make a change, "If I got diabetes or a heart attack or something like that." (P8) Other participants, however, who already had health challenges also reported having difficulty becoming motivated to change their eating behavior. One participant with Type II diabetes shared her reaction to getting the news from her doctor that she would need to get back on Metformin (a diabetes medication) because her illness had worsened: "'Damn.' That's what I said instead of, 'All I got to do is…lose 10 pounds. That's a start and it will go down and I won't need [the medication].'…It's almost like I don't care…I need the kick in the ass. What do I do? Where does that come from?" (P18) Several participants, however, felt consistent motivation. For them, motivation for making eating behavior changes came from their desire to maintain their health so they could continue to take care of other people in their life. One participant, who was the sole guardian of her granddaughter and was concerned she may die if she did not change her eating behavior, related her reasons for wanting to make: "I think that everything is motivated around [my granddaughter], not leaving her. If I didn't have her, I probably wouldn't care as much, honestly." (P21)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIT and Motivation</head><p>Participants provided examples and suggestions for how HIT could sustain preexisting user motivation-although none saw a way for current HIT to help them move from an unmotivated to a motivated state. One participant described her experience with an online weight loss game through which she bet money that she would lose a certain amount of weight within a particular timeframe. But as it turned out, the HIT-mediated emotional support she gave and received was a greater motivation for her than the financial incentive of meeting her weight loss goal. She discussed visiting the HIT community forum for motivational messages from other players, as well as to post motivational messages to the forum: "It keeps me going. It keeps the fire lit for me to keep going." (P12) She also described what happened when she stopped reading and contributing to the forums for a period of time: "The weight crept on…So then I started back up again and I'm back on it. I'm actually lower than when I first weighed in a year ago, so I'm doing good." (P12) Many participants (n = 8) appreciated how some HIT (Lose It! and other smartphone apps) supports users in maintaining motivation by providing "rewards" such as badges for reaching goals. As one participant suggested more HIT do, "Reward [users] often for hitting certain walking goals, like a little thing that would pop up and (ringing sound), "Congratulations! You've reached your 10,000-step count!'" (P20) A minority of participants (n = 2), however, did not particularly like such motivating messages. One participant explained her reaction to receiving encouraging messages from Lose It! and other smartphone apps (e.g., congratulations for reaching a goal), "I don't like a cheerleader. There are a lot of fitness apps and stuff that are like 'Way to go.'…This stuff is not sincere." (P3) The participant noted that this kind of "fake encouragement" was "unnecessary" and made her feel "really uncomfortable." (P3) While she acknowledged that other users might like it, she emphasized that it was simply personal preference that lead her to dislike these types of motivational messages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Handling Stress</head><p>Participants reported the three following areas of support needs related to their coping response to stress: eating with awareness to avoid using ESRE as a coping response to stress, using emotional support and HIT-generated encouragement as a safeguard against ESRE, and understanding ESRE coping and changing the mindset underlying ESRE behavior for lasting behavior change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eating with Awareness</head><p>Participants reported the value of being aware of what they ate in their efforts to curb ESRE as a coping method. Some participants shared that eating with awareness helped them control the amount of food they ate. One participant stated her need to have an "active thought process" through which she thought through the following: "'I should stop now and save this for another meal,'…'I can just get a small snack, I'm not actually that hungry.'" (P4) She further noted, "If I just auto-pilot myself, I think I would eat too much."(P4)</p><p>In support of awareness, many participants acknowledged that HIT with food tracking functionality encouraged them to consider their serving sizes. As one participant described, although nutrition information was readily accessible on food packaging, logging it with HIT was beneficial because: "I could have just opened it and ignored the wrapper…[logging in the app] forced me to face things that I knew already." (P11) Additionally, many participants stated that sometimes they needed assistance with considering the reasons underlying their desires to eat food at certain times, and with interrogating their underlying emotional state or stress levels. One participant related that when she is stressed and walking to the vending machine to buy peanut M&amp;Ms, she would appreciate hearing, "Hey, I see you're going to get the peanut M&amp;Ms. Are you feeling stressed?" (P5) Participants suggested combined food and emotion tracking functionalities in HIT could slow themselves down to think about why they were eating and reevaluate if it was a good idea. As one participant suggested, tracking emojis that represented feelings at the time of eating could encourage mindful eating because usually, "In the moment you're not thinking about, 'Hey, how are you feeling?' Or 'Is this a stress snack?'" (P9)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safeguarding Against ESRE Through Emotional Support</head><p>Participants reported a great need to fortify themselves against using ESRE as a coping response to stress. One participant described the benefits of emotional support in context of weight loss efforts as follows: "[It] really, really helps…being able to…celebrate successes and if somebody's having a bad day and they fell off the wagon…it's encouragement, not like, 'You failed,' but 'It's okay.'" (P22) Additionally, some participants made a direct connection between getting emotional support and their eating behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>One participant shared why emotional support is helpful for curbing ESRE: "I quite like the fact that you have someone else with you…to see how you're doing…because when I eat the most, and I eat the worst, I am alone...when I'm not talking to people, I eat." (P16)</head><p>Addressing stress and negative affect that could potentially lead to overeating was important for participants. Many participants reported how they depended on other people to work through negative emotions and stress by venting and processing their feelings. As one participant related, "Normally, I either reflect on my own and then talk to my sisters or reflect through talking to my sisters." (P4) Some participants also developed relationships with coworkers that allowed them to discuss stressors. As one participant described her one-on-one time with a coworker during the workday, "We get outside, we have a trail that goes around the building…We get away from everybody so we can talk out any issues that we're having with work…or our life things." (P11) A critical caveat for receiving emotional support was getting it from people with whom they had something in common. The most basic level of commonality was people who had similar struggles with overweight/obesity. One participant commented: "There's nothing quite like having someone who I know has been in my shoes in terms of the overweight experience and existing as an overweight person in the world, being kind of that voice of reason." (P5)</p><p>Other participants further emphasized their desire to receive emotional support from people who were not only addressing overweight/obesity themselves, but who were also in the same phase of life. For instance, one participant reported supportive relationships where she and the other person understood both the professional and personal demands they faced along with weight management experiences: "I really kind of relied on the friend of mine…because we're the same year in our programs...[we can] more openly talk about our goals…Our struggles. Our frustrations. Why things are working, why things aren't working." (P2) Additional participants reported how they also appreciated emotional support exchange related to overweight/obesity with people who shared their social position. For instance, one participant described how she felt "comradery" with the other women in her Weight Watchers meeting group: "[To] come together on a subject that is fraught, and has a lot of baggage associated with it. And we all have our own paths. And it was just nice to be in a room of all women and to have fellowship over all of that." (P10)</p><p>Interacting with a trusted person or group of people was not only beneficial in terms of the comfort participants felt, but also because it motivated them to stay connected with others and continue to engage in the process of addressing their emotional health and eating behavior. One participant related how she started working out with a physical trainer who held exercise classes in small groups, which helped to sustain her motivation for health-enhancing behavior: "I really liked the group and my trainer, and then after a while all of us became friends, and it became like we hung out on the weekends, so it had a really good family feel to it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>So I think that's what kept me going is because I liked what I was doing and who I was doing it with." (P8)</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIT and Safeguarding Against ESRE</head><p>Participants widely reported wanting HIT to provide opportunities for emotional support and feelings of encouragement. Some participants strongly endorsed HIT providing a structure for the exchange of emotional support. One participant stated that if designing HIT for ESRE, she would be sure to include a forum for user communications with one another for the following reasons: "People want to feel connected…Especially around food and relationships with food, there's this great sense of isolation or secrecy…there's power in community and knowing that you're in it with other people who are also striving for the same goals." (P20)</p><p>In terms of messages generated by HIT, participants had the main desire for it to encourage and to inspire a positive attitude about themselves, their lives generally, and their weight loss process. One participant shared how she thought HIT-generated messages could make her feel good: "Send me a nice quote or <ref type="bibr">[biblical]</ref> scripture…give me all the warm, fuzzy [feelings]-just something to prevent me going in to eating bad." (P8) Other respondents suggested a more direct approach: "I would want something that would tell me, 'You're awesome…you can do this.'" (P12) There were strong ideas as well about what technology should not do to ensure that actions were in fact perceived as supportive. One participant cautioned that HIT-generated messages had to strike the delicate balance of persistence without annoyance: "[It should] most closely mimic a really supportive person in my life. So something that is in my face, but in the least obnoxious way ever…it has to be keeping reminding me of its existence and…being engaging in a friendly way without going overboard on it." (P5)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Understanding ESRE Behavior</head><p>Participants were generally interested not just in changing their ESRE behavior, but also understanding it so that they could rely on it less as a coping method. One participant related how she was employing different behavioral strategies, such as surrounding herself with healthier food options and engaging in mindful eating practices, to mitigate her ESRE. Nonetheless, she wanted to know why she was drawn to ESRE. She stated, "I haven't figured it out yet...maybe through counseling, eventually, I can peel back the onion and say, 'Why do I turn to food for comfort?'" (P6)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIT and Understanding ESRE Behavior</head><p>Participants were interested in using HIT to learn about themselves and to identify behavior they could not see on their own. One participant shared that she generally liked to use HIT (Lose It! and other smartphone apps) to track her dietary intake for short periods of time to get a snapshot of her eating behavior through answering the following questions</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>: "What are my current patterns? What needs attention? What is this chunk of data telling me about what's conscious or not? What needs more work?" (P10)</head><p>Many participants noted that while calorie and physical activity tracking was helpful for weight management efforts, keeping record of their emotions would also be useful for gaining greater insight into their ESRE behavior. One participant related that HIT that supported emotion tracking would be beneficial because, as she stated, "It would force me to do that self-reflection that I already know is good for me and sometimes I avoid or sometimes I don't get to as a first response to a feeling." (P4)</p><p>A number of participants further suggested that HIT be designed to allow for tracking food/drink in tandem with emotions. Participants widely thought that such information would allow them to become aware of their ESRE behavior and to make behavior changes accordingly: "It would be good to be able have just kind of a one-stop shopping, to have all that information [i.e.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>, food and emotion]. I feel like I need to have as much information as I can to figure out what kind of changes would be best for me." (P14)</head><p>In addition to food-emotion tracking, some participants were interested in tracking physical feelings in their body at the time they ate. They wanted to discern when they may have eaten certain foods for reasons aside from hunger or emotions. One participant explained that HIT would be most helpful if it were designed to be "more inclusive of other life activities…like 'Did you have a headache?' Things like that." (P2) She noted that kind of information would be helpful because, "When I have headaches I eat more because I feel like maybe my blood sugar's low…so just seeing I had a headache that day, maybe that's why I had that second slice of pizza or that third slice of pizza."(P2)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Changing the ESRE Mindset</head><p>Many participants also reported the belief that they needed to make a fundamental shift in their thinking to stop using ESRE as a coping response. As one participant commented on her eating behavior: "It needs to change within me…it's my mindset." (P2) Furthermore, such change was viewed as a requirement for achieving lasting eating behavior change.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>One participant related, "You have to change your way of thinking because if you go in and say, 'I'm going to change my lifestyle. I'm going to get rid of all of this and replace it with all of this,' but you still think the same way, what good is replacing anything?"</head><p>More specifically, some participants identified the need to reset their thinking about food's purpose in their lives. Each participant acknowledged that food should not be used to make themselves feel better when experiencing negative emotions or stress. One related, "Food is not love, food is food." (P6) A number of participants reported success in changing the way they related to food when they thought about food primarily in terms of its nutritional characteristics. One participant who experienced some success in adopting healthier eating behaviors, noted how she started evaluating food not as "good" or "bad" but rather in terms of whether it gave her what she needed: "I'm not eating vegetables because they're good or not good, but because it gives me something,..</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[When] I eat pizza and ice cream…I don't think I've eaten that badly…I try to frame it in my mind like, 'Your body really didn't get anything that it needed.'" (P1)</head><p>Participants also described challenges in changing their thinking as it related to their eating behavior. Participants who attempted to make a change in the way they thought about food reported that the process takes a long time. One participant who had gastric bypass surgery and lost 100 lbs. described her transition: "[W]hen I'm sad I want to eat. I want to find comfort in something and it's always been food. Now I'm trying to change that into finding different comfort.</p><p>The gym, I read a lot…it's like trying to re-train my brain, and that's the hardest part…I'm still not fully there with it mentally, it's going to take time." (P17)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIT and Changing the ESRE Mindset</head><p>Participants largely reported that HIT such as Lose It! and other applications they had used supported putting certain health behaviors in action, but did not shift the way they thought about their behavior. This was particularly salient for HIT with the ubiquitous and popular functionality of food tracking. Many participants reported that HIT food logging was effective in encouraging them to plan meals so that they would stay within a certain daily calorie count. Some, however, shared how in certain situations they circumvented the logging and ate in excess of the daily calorie guidelines.</p><p>One participant described such sidestepping in her approach to holiday meals: "I'm going to eat what I want…and count it [in the HIT tracking app] and I'll deal with the consequences later." (P6) Another participant described her feelings about HIT food logging when it could be a "hassle," such as on vacation, "If I ate a lot of food, I just wouldn't put it [into the HIT tracking app], you just avoid the problem and then you'd move on to the next day." (P3) As a result, some participants reported going through the motions of using the HIT or selectively recording food items in their log, and did not necessarily shift their thought patterns regarding eating behavior.</p><p>Additionally, HIT food tracking was viewed as a temporary, unsustainable measure. One participant described why her use of HIT food logging was limited to relatively short time periods: "I found it very...exhausting…I would…stop using it once I felt like I was in a healthier place. I think it's a really valuable tool, but I don't really want to live my life tracking food." (P11) As a result, HIT food tracking functionality had the potential to shape eating behavior in the short term, but had a relatively narrow timespan to address participants' underlying mindset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>This study describes the needs of overweight/obese women who engage in ESRE, and sets out issues they encounter when using HIT designed for weight management via eating behavior modification. Overweight/obese women who engage in ESRE define their health goals in holistic terms that extend beyond weight. Some overweight/obese women struggle with motivating themselves to initiate and sustain eating behavior change. Additionally, overweight/obese women who engage in ESRE have a need for emotional support to avoid ESRE as a coping response to stress, as well as understanding their behavior and changing their mindsets.</p><p>Novel results from this study suggest that overweight/obese women who engage in ESRE could benefit from HIT supporting their holistic view of health so as to spur and sustain motivation for eating behavior change. Additionally, the results point to the key role HIT can play in helping users feel good and connected to others, thereby sustaining motivation and safeguarding against ESRE behavior.</p><p>Furthermore, results indicate it would be beneficial for overweight/obese women who engage in ESRE to have HIT that helps with real time eating awareness, as well as understanding their ESRE behavior, and changing their ESRE mindset, thereby reducing ESRE behavior as a coping response to stress. These and related HIT design implications are discussed further here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Need for Goal Articulation and Motivation</head><p>Just as previous HCI research has suggested that HIT should support a diversity of health goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">46]</ref>, our work too shows the critical need to support holistic health goals that are more varied than body weight measures. Notably, some participants found that although they wanted to focus on health rather than weight, it was difficult to do so. Moreover, the focus of HIT on weight-loss goals points to a limitation in the prevailing HIT intervention model for people who engage in ESRE. Better alignment of goals is needed since previous research highlights the importance of focusing on the appropriate kinds of goals that underlie motivation to enact and sustain health behavior changes. For instance, Segar, Eccles, &amp; Richardson found that midlife women (40-60 years old) with outcome goals focused on immediate benefits (e.g., sleeping better, reducing stress, etc.) rather than long term benefits exercised more than those who had goals of overall health and disease prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[53]</ref>. This suggests the potential benefits of translating holistic health goals into shorter term objectives for overweight/obese women who engage in ESRE. Some participants report difficulty finding motivation for enacting and sustaining eating behavior change. They noted that only the onset of illness would get them to change their eating behavior. But such motivation was even lacking in participants who already had weight-related health issues. These findings are consistent with prior research that indicates health behavior enacted with intrinsic motivation (i.e., action based on interest or values) is more effective and sustainable than health behavior enacted based on extrinsic motivation (i.e., action based on threat, reward, obligation, or guilt) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">52]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIT Design Implications</head><p>Based on the above findings, HIT should support a focus on intrinsic, immediate goals that are ascertainable in the short term. HIT should leverage existing user desire to achieve goals beyond extrinsic motivations such as losing weight to look thin. As suggested by participants, HIT could reframe weight loss in terms of immediate quality of life improvements they would experience by losing smaller increments of weight (e.g., meeting weight requirement to go horseback riding with family members), in terms of habit changes rather than outcomes, and in terms of broader holistic health goals that do not concern weight at all. Additionally, there should be a focus on building motivation even when it is not present; use of holistic goals might help with this as well. Technology currently available would be able to provide such support to users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Feeling Good and Connected to Others</head><p>Our participants want to feel good about themselves and connected to other people; such feelings made participants more committed to weight management efforts. As for emotional support, participants find it particularly helpful when they stray away from their weight management plan and celebrate goal achievements. Additionally, emotional support in context of venting and processing feelings provides alternatives to eating as a means of coping with stress and negative emotions. Furthermore, participants preferred emotional support from people who had similar experiences with overweight/obesity, were in the same phase of life, or shared their social position (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, age, etc.). These findings are in line with other research that showed emotional support improves sustained weight loss over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">54]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIT Design Implications</head><p>Based on the above findings, HIT should help users feel good about themselves and their weight management process. <ref type="bibr">Cordeiro et al.</ref> shows that food tracking can elicit feelings of shame and judgement <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>; our findings highlight the particular need to avoid this in an ESRE context. Additionally, our findings that suggest emphasizing the positive add empirical weight to Grimes &amp; Harper's appeal to design technologies that celebrate users' interactions with food <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</p><p>HIT should also mediate meaningful exchange of emotional support between users. Participants said giving and receiving emotional support keeps them actively engaged in weight management efforts, however only one participant reported such support via current HIT. Additionally, emotional support exchange offers opportunity for non-food related stress reduction. While previous HCI work shows that users seek social support online to aid in healthy eating [e.g., 10], participants' emphasis on venting and processing emotions with others suggests unique design features for this group, such as a "venting space," where judgement-free, open emotional expression is encouraged. In creating such spaces, HIT should extend beyond surface-level exchanges to development of sustained relationship bonds between similarly situated users.</p><p>Additionally, participants generally found HIT-generated encouragement to be helpful, though not all participants are highly enthusiastic about such communications. The varying reactions to automated HIT-generated encouragement messages was found in other research as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[60]</ref>. Although most current HIT designed for weight management does not allow for personalization of the types of encouraging messages users receive, they should allow feature tailoring (e.g., timing, frequency, subject matter, etc.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Need for Real Time Awareness and Deeper Reflection</head><p>Participants report a need to make just-in-time evaluations of quantities and types of food eaten, as well as the reason for eating the food. Such real-time awareness is thought to prevent ESRE behavior. Additionally, participants report assistance with reflection on ESRE behavior can lead to greater insight and changed mindset. This finding corroborates previous research that suggests discerning personal health-related patterns over time can be challenging and requires support [e.g., 2].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIT Design Implications</head><p>Based on the above findings, HIT should support overweight/obese women who engage in ESRE to be cognizant of their real-time food coping response to stress, as well as understand their behavior over time and change their mindset. To assist in real-time awareness, we recommend further investigations of sensors to provide feedback on emotional states as a potential precursor to ESRE behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">47]</ref>. As for deeper reflection, while previous HCI research has looked at how HIT-mediated reflection supports healthy eating behavior change in contexts as varied as reflection-through-performance in the form of sharing eating behavior activities within a local community <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[44]</ref> and newly diagnosed diabetes patients discussing routine breakdowns with health educators <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[34]</ref>, future research should extend our understanding to that of how to best scaffold reflection in an ESRE context.</p><p>Many participants suggested HIT functionality that allowed tracking emotional state along with dietary intake. Rooksby et al. found such "diagnostic tracking" to understand the interrelationship between different health factors (e.g., diet and stomach ache) to be popular among only a "couple" of users in their study, and stated that the "realities of diagnostics were rather mundane" <ref type="bibr">[48, p. 1168</ref>]. Our work, however, strongly suggests that overweight/obese women who engage in ESRE could benefit from diagnostic tracking that comprises simultaneous logging of diet and emotions. We urge that the potential "mundanity" of diagnostic tracking could be preempted by thoughtful design. While prior HCI research related to food diaries has greatly focused on reducing user burden to increase food tracking [e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">42]</ref>, we argue that methods for simple and engaging tandem food and emotion tracking be explored just as intensely. For instance, Carroll et al. developed and studied EmoTree, an experimental smartphone app that allowed for tracking affect along with dietary intake <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>. About one-third of study participants reported greater awareness of when they were engaging in ESRE as a result of logging food and emotions at the same time. These findings suggest that HIT should be designed to support users practice real time eating with awareness, as well as to provide deeper insights without relying on users to figure it out on their own. Furthermore, HIT should be developed to provide such insights on a range of behaviors. HIT could perhaps push messages to users that state kinds of food or times of day a user tends to eat when self-reporting stress. With some design modifications, currently available technology could support users in these ways.</p><p>Finally, notwithstanding the usefulness of tracking, participants concede they tend to use tracking for relatively short periods of time. This corroborates previous HCI research that indicates short term use and abandonment of HIT tracking tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">48]</ref>. As a result, and similar to the perspective articulated by previous researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">48]</ref>, it is advisable to focus on how tracking tools can be used effectively in relatively short periods of time to support reflection for enacting and maintaining behavior change. For instance, similar to how one participant uses food tracking tools, they could be used strategically to ascertain an overview of eating over a short period of time for the user to become aware of, think about, and address undesirable behavioral patterns. Additionally, self-experimentation tools could benefit users. These tools could assist users in answering self-generated health questions through collecting data and analyzing data with hypotheses testing to determine causal relationships (e.g., whether a low carbohydrate diet causes weight loss). Though not currently widely available, such self-experimentation tools could be further developed to support users interested in understanding their ESRE behavior, its triggers, and evaluating their responses to deliberately-isolated changes in their behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">26]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LIMITATIONS</head><p>Some HIT recommendations from participants could have been shaped by use of the Lose It! smartphone app (free version) before their interview, which could have limited participants thinking about HIT. Participants, however, also related experiences with other weight management HITthough most of these were food tracking smartphone apps as well. Despite these limitations, participant feedback on weight management app features is helpful for guiding design of these ubiquitous weight management tools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>Study findings showed the unique needs of overweight/obese women for technology support in the areas of: 1) holistic health goals, 2) initiating and sustaining motivation; 3) venting and processing emotions, 4) real time eating awareness, 5) understanding behavior and changing mindset, and 6) simultaneous tracking of emotions and dietary intake to facilitate such understanding. Prevailing HIT interventions provide limited support in relation to such needs. Accordingly, findings suggest new directions for improving HIT design for ESRE, a behavior more common in women. Notably, although women make up the majority of subjects in weight loss intervention studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref> and are the weight management market's main target population <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[36]</ref>, there has been a dearth of interventions that address their specific needs. Accordingly, by focusing on the needs of overweight/obese women in particular, results hold potential for improving design for the largest group of digital weight loss intervention users.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
