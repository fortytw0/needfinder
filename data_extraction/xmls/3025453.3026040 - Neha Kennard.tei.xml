<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Although research has demonstrated improved outcomes for outpatients who receive peer support-such as through online health communities, support groups, and mentoring systems-hospitalized patients have few mechanisms to receive such valuable support. To explore the opportunities for a hospital-based peer support system, we administered a survey to 146 pediatric patients and caregivers, and conducted semi-structured interviews with twelve patients and three caregivers in a children's hospital. Our analysis revealed that hospitalized individuals need peer support for five key purposes: (1) to ask about medical details-such as procedures, treatments, and medications; (2) to learn about healthcare providers; (3) to report and prevent medical errors; (4) to exchange emotional support; and (5) to manage their time in the hospital. In this paper, we examine these themes and describe potential barriers to using a hospital-based peer support system. We then discuss the unique opportunities and challenges that the hospital environment presents when designing for peer support in this setting.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>In the United States, over 34 million hospital admissions occurred in <ref type="bibr">2014 [52]</ref>. For many hospitalized individuals, their time spent between admission and discharge becomes extremely overwhelming and difficult to navigate. Patients and their caregivers must learn the intricate details of the care they are receiving and the complicated structure of the hospital hierarchy. They must also monitor information handoffs among their healthcare providers and remain vigilant due to the high risk of experiencing a preventable medical error <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[33]</ref>. On top of this work, they need to manage the symptoms, stress, and anxiety that emerge as a result of being in the hospital. One way to alleviate these health, information, and emotional burdens is to offer patients and caregivers the support of their peers, who can guide them through the many challenges of an unfamiliar hospital environment.</p><p>Evidence indicates that patients who participate in such peer support programs experience health benefits, such as increased adherence to medication, and improved clinical outcomes <ref type="bibr">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">47]</ref>. Technology-based peer support also provides an easily accessible medium for patients to find specific, tailored information related to their experience, to increase their knowledge, to strengthen their social bonds, and to feel a sense of belonging to a community <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">38,</ref><ref type="bibr">50]</ref>. A combination of these benefits and resources can lead to increased self-management, efficacy, and empowerment in their care <ref type="bibr">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">31]</ref>. However, research in the medical and HCI fields has typically focused on peer support for patients and caregivers with chronic conditions, who manage their care activities at home or in a clinic, instead of in the hospital.</p><p>To understand the opportunities and barriers for a peer support system in a hospital setting, we conducted two studies with pediatric patients and their caregivers. The first was a survey to identify the types of advice the participants wanted to share with others who have similar hospital experiences. These results served as the foundation for our second study: semi-structured interviews that incorporated "feature cards" of a hypothetical, hospital-based peer support system. Participants reacted to these features and provided their perspectives on exchanging information and interacting with peers during their time in the hospital.</p><p>In this paper, we describe five major types of information and support that hospitalized patients and caregivers want to exchange with their peers, and examine the potential barriers to using a peer support system in the hospital. Our primary contributions consist of:  Providing a deep understanding of the informational and emotional peer support needs that patients and caregivers have, but are not currently supported during hospitalization, and  Identifying opportunities, barriers, and design considerations for a peer support system to be used in the hospital.</p><p>These contributions have implications for peer support systems to increase engagement, reduce errors, and improve health outcomes for patients and caregivers in the hospital.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BACKGROUND</head><p>When patients and caregivers are seeking knowledge and support about their health, many turn to online resources <ref type="bibr">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr">12]</ref>. Tools such as mobile applications, social media, and online communities help these individuals to find relevant medical information, share ideas about managing their care, and gather the strength needed to cope with their illness <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">44]</ref>. These manifestations of informational and emotional support are valuable and distinct from the resources given by their healthcare provider <ref type="bibr">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">19]</ref>.</p><p>Many types of options exist to facilitate peer support for a wide range of healthcare settings and patients, but hospitalbased interventions do not always employ digital solutions. Rather, dyads of current and previous patients typically meet face-to-face for mentoring sessions <ref type="bibr">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">45]</ref>. Additionally, Jacobs and colleagues describe the role of cancer navigators, who assist cancer patients during different stages of their illness and treatment by answering questions, providing emotional support, and helping the patient apply for resources. These support services are nearly always provided in-person <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref>.</p><p>As one type of option outside the hospital, text messaging has been used to engage patients with their peers, especially with individuals managing chronic conditions at home, sometimes in low resource settings. For example, Franklin et al. implemented a mobile, text message support system called Sweet Talk for young patients living with type 1 diabetes to exchange "information, tips, and reminders", customize the timing of messages to appear before a clinic visit, and establish personal goals-such as regular insulin injections, blood glucose testing, healthy eating, and exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. A similar strategy by Rotheram-Borus et al. was conducted by linking women who have diabetes with a "buddy" via text message for 12 weeks. The pairs encouraged each other's adherence to their disease management tasks at home <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[43]</ref>. Both studies resulted in participants who engaged with their newfound community, and who demonstrated improved clinical outcomes.</p><p>Using increasingly popular smartphones, patients who are managing diabetes or obesity symptoms at home and between clinic visits can use dedicated mobile applications.</p><p>These tools allow peers to share their daily fitness data and participate in a larger social network to promote healthy lifestyle changes-such as losing weight, exercising more, or improving eating habits <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">10]</ref>.</p><p>A less common but appealing option, multi-user environments, have been explored by Bers et al., with the development of Zora, a three-dimensional environment where pediatric patients can create their own artifacts and form characters that interact with other users. Intended to help peers build a network and improve their medical adherence, this tool was designed for both diabetic patients to pass time during clinic visits, and for patients who were home from the hospital after receiving a solid organ transplant <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Similarly, Chin and Tsuei made a multiuser system for hospitalized patients with chronic illness to create narrative stories and share them with peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Websites and online forums provide additional means of support for patients and caregivers affected by a number of health issues, most notably chronic conditions-such as diabetes, obesity, cancer, and mental illness <ref type="bibr">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">28,</ref><ref type="bibr">51]</ref>.</p><p>Reach Out! is one example that provides a place for young people with mental illness to discuss information and helpseeking strategies, with input and moderation by trained professionals. This program particularly helps reduce isolation of individuals who do not seek face-to-face support from their healthcare provider <ref type="bibr">[48]</ref>.</p><p>More recently, social media has emerged as a way to find people dealing with similar health-related problems. Facebook has allowed people to document their experiences, communicate with others through personal profiles, and create specialized "groups" <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">40]</ref>.</p><p>Researchers have also analyzed YouTube-hosted health vlogs generated by patients diagnosed with cancer, HIV, and diabetes. This platform is used to document vloggers clinic or hospital visits, discuss their treatments and day-today management of their chronic illness, and share emotional struggles experienced at each significant point of their care process <ref type="bibr">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr">29]</ref>. Additionally, Liu et al. found that chronically ill pediatric patients use a combination of social media, video chat, and texting to maintain a degree of normalcy, social support, and emotional support with existing friends <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[30]</ref>. Yet, we know little about how these tools can help hospitalized patients support each other.</p><p>In summary, the examples mentioned here represent a broad spectrum of solutions that make it easier for people to access the informational and emotional support they need, as well as share experiences and expertise acquired over time. Although some of these technologies are accessible to hospitalized patients, less is known about how the successful models of peer support tools translate to the hospital environment. Questions still remain about what the nature of peer support is among patients who share a similar hospital experience, and how to tailor this support to the specific needs of these individuals. Our research fills this knowledge gap and builds on prior work by uncovering the specific types of support that hospitalized patients and caregivers want during their stay, and are willing to share with their peers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p>In this paper, we report and discuss findings from two studies: (1) a survey, and (2) semi-structured interviews, including feedback on feature cards of a hypothetical, hospital-based peer support system. We define peers in this context as people with similar health and hospital experiences. This work was conducted with hospitalized patients and caregivers, and is part of a larger study to identify opportunities for patients and caregivers to increase engagement in their care and prevent medical errors during their hospital stay <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">41]</ref>. Results from the survey informed the development of the "feature cards" used in the interviews. Each study was approved by the authors' Institutional Review Board.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Site and Consent Process</head><p>Both the surveys and interviews were conducted at Seattle Children's Hospital in Seattle, WA. The hospital serves a broad geographic region, with pediatric patient demographics being slightly more diverse than the surrounding area's population. This organization manages approximately 300 beds and admits over 15,000 patients per year.</p><p>For each study, consent was obtained for all participants. If the participant was between 7 and 13 years old, the caregiver-usually a parent-provided written consent, followed by verbal assent from the pediatric patient. For patients aged 14 or above, parental consent was not required, and the patients provided written assent. Patients and caregivers were often, but not always, co-present while the studies were conducted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Survey</head><p>We developed a web-based survey instrument hosted by SurveyGizmo, which asked patients and caregivers about their experiences with an undesirable event, which we explicitly defined as an event that (1) was a small or big concern, (2) was unpleasant or caused harm, and (3) could have been avoided. Examples include: sleeping in an uncomfortable bed, experiencing a communication problem with their doctor, or receiving the wrong medication. The survey instrument went through several rounds of editing and pilot testing to ensure the questions and format were at an appropriate reading and comprehension level for eligible respondents. The final version consisted of 30 closed-and open-ended questions asking details about the event (e.g., When did the event happen? Were you a patient or caregiver at the time of the event? Please describe the event in your own words).</p><p>Recruitment occurred over a five-month period between February 2016 -July 2016. Our research team approached patients and caregivers in the hospital's acute and intensive care units. They were considered eligible for the study if they met the following criteria: were at least 7 years old, were well enough to provide informed consent, were comfortable reading and writing in English, had spent at least one night in the hospital as part of their current stay, and had experienced an undesirable event during either the current or a previous hospital visit. A research team member would administer the survey to the consented individuals on an iPad, and was available to answer questions or help the respondent take the survey if necessary. The iPad was cleaned with sanitizing wipes before and after each use to prevent hospital infection. More information about this study and preliminary results can be read elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Unlike the other survey questions that asked specific details about the participant's undesirable event, only one question focused on peer support: "What advice would you give to others who might have had an <ref type="bibr">[undesirable]</ref> event like this in the hospital?" This question was intended to elicit the respondent's knowledge gained through their hospital experience, and explore their willingness to share this knowledge with their peers. Of the 146 survey responses, 131 (89.7%) provided a free text answer to this question. We report these answers in addition to the results of our semi-structured interviews.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Semi-Structured Interviews</head><p>To further explore perspectives that patients and caregivers have on receiving information and communicating with their peers in a broader context than hospital safety, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 hospitalized patients and caregivers. The interview consisted of an activity to design a patient-facing mobile application. This design activity involved multiple sets of "feature cards" inspired by envisioning cards, to draw out the values and preferences of patients and caregivers.</p><p>The themes that emerged from the survey analysis gave preliminary indications of the types of advice hospitalized individuals were compelled to share with their peers. To better understand what participants want to exchange with their peers, how they want to interact, and why they want to connect, we developed a subset of 6 feature cards that represented hypothetical components of a hospital-based peer support tool: (1) "Advice about being in the hospital" (2) "What to do when you notice a problem" (3) "Share your advice with others" (4) "Chat with another patient" (5) "Read other patient stories" and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) "Filter patients by age, similar health issue, currently in the hospital, or other".</p><p>Examples are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>The research team member conducting the interview asked participants to respond to the feature cards and explain their reasoning or thought process behind their response. For example, if patients said they were interested in chatting with another patient, we would follow up by asking why they were interested and what they would want to chat with the other patient about. All interviews took place between July 2016 -August 2016 and were audio recorded and transcribed for analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Survey Respondents</head><p>Demographics of the 131 survey responses we received for the question, "What advice would you give to others who might have had an <ref type="bibr">[undesirable]</ref> event like this in the hospital?" are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Most respondents identified as White/Caucasian and Female. One hundred twenty-three (94.6%) reported using a smartphone, tablet, or laptop device during their most recent hospital stay. Fifty-three respondents indicated that they (either as a patient or caregiver) had at least 10 overnight hospital stays in the last 5 years.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interview Participants</head><p>We interviewed a total of 15 individuals. Twelve were pediatric patients, ranging in age from 7-17, divided equally between males and females. The remaining 3 were caregivers of pediatric patients between the ages of 30-39 years old, consisting of one male and two females. Race and ethnicity of these participants were as follows: 11 White/Caucasian, 1 Black/African American, 3 Hispanic/Latin American, 1 Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 1 Asian. Twelve people (80%) indicated that they owned a smartphone. Three of our 15 participants had never visited the hospital before their current admission.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>We used a grounded theory approach to analyze both the survey and interview data <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[46]</ref>. The first author (SH) served as the primary coder for the survey responses. After each round of coding, SH met with the rest of the research team to discuss emergent themes, discrepancies, and codebook revisions. While interviews were conducted, three members of the research team (SH, SRM, MK) met regularly to iteratively develop a codebook based on emerging themes. After reaching saturation, SH, SRM, and MK independently coded interview transcripts. SH then compared the common threads and distinct themes of both data sets. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>Our analysis revealed five primary themes that were consistent across our survey and interview results: (1) asking about medical details-such as procedures, treatments, or medications, (2) learning about providers, (3) reporting and preventing medical errors, (4) exchanging emotional support, and (5) managing time in the hospital. In addition, we describe potential barriers to using a hospitalbased peer support system, which include (1) synchronous vs. asynchronous communication, and (2) preferences for viewing and sharing content.</p><p>To differentiate between the participants in each study discussed in this paper, we refer to survey responses as S# and interview participants as I#, followed by their status as either a patient or caregiver. During survey data collection, we assigned unique identifiers to each survey initiated, even if the response was never completed. Therefore, some S# values are greater than the number of complete responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Asking about Procedures, Treatments, or Medications</head><p>Patients and caregiver emphasized the importance of getting information about the patient's care, from their healthcare providers as well as their peers. Survey respondents repeatedly encouraged their peer counterparts to ask questions and request follow-up information from doctors and nurses. S94, a pediatric patient who had unexpected complications during a surgery and whose providers did not properly follow post-surgery instructions, wanted other patients to feel comfortable requesting information about procedures and complicated medical terminology: Participants in each study identified both their providers and peers as valuable sources of information. By encouraging each other to actively seek information and ask about care details, patients and caregivers can increase their knowledge, prepare for their upcoming experience, and maintain a realistic perspective of the patient's health status.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Don't</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Learning about Providers</head><p>Some of our survey respondents and interview participants wanted to talk about their healthcare providers with peers. Providers were a common topic of discussion among those who had a chronic or rare health condition, and wanted to know more information about the doctors who specialize in their care. I04, a patient, said this when talking about advice she would want to read from other patients: Similarly, many survey respondents shared advice for what to do when a patient's or caregiver's relationship with their provider is difficult. Through their own hospital experiences, respondents described the options available to a patient and caregiver that might not be commonly known. For example, one caregiver described receiving unsatisfactory care from a provider, which caused her to ask for a different doctor:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">I04: You could</formula><p>When your child is in the hospital, ask to speak to a pediatrician immediately. I didn't know I had to request that, I assumed that since he was a child, we would of course speak to a Dr. for children.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>-S228, Caregiver</head><p>Respondents also encouraged other patients to facilitate communication among providers (i.e., asking providers if they had spoken to another provider), to avoid communication problems, and involve a third party such as a second opinion, hospital staff supervisor, social worker, family advocate, or legal advisor if disagreements start to affect the patient's quality of care.</p><p>The quality of a patient or caregiver's relationship with their provider can greatly affect their experience in the hospital. Advice on how to evaluate and maintain this relationship proved to be important for many participants, because they wanted to avoid potential conflicts and receive the best care possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reporting and Preventing Medical Errors</head><p>Alerting someone to a serious problem was another consistent theme in both survey responses and interviews with patients and caregivers. One survey respondent, who was mistakenly administered too much laughing gas before a procedure, discussed the importance of reporting medical errors such as hers:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report what happened to you. I wonder all the time if the anesthesiologist has done this to other children, especially children younger than I am who had no way of knowing what was happening to them. -S129, Patient</head><p>Information from other patients about methods for identifying and preventing errors in the hospital was also valuable for many of the pediatric patients we interviewed. In addition to these examples, advice on how to avoid errors mainly came from our survey respondents, who offered strategies such as remaining alert, paying attention to details of their care, keeping track of lab tests, and following up with their healthcare providers if needed. Many respondents also emphasized double medicine labels to help prevent drug-related errors such as a medication known to cause an allergic reaction, an incorrect dose, or administering the drug inappropriately.</p><p>to the prevalence and danger of preventable medical in the hospital setting, patients were aware of the for constant vigilance and prompt reporting. Increased awareness among peers about risks and types of error has the potential to improve early detection and</p><p>Exchanging Emotional Support from each study discussed the idea of giving to and receiving support from their by means of forming friendships, talking about their general health experiences, offering encouragement.</p><p>with other patients who were of the same age health condition, or hospital was frequently as an important aspect of communicating with peers. For many participants, this potential interaction was an opportunity to establish friendships and share hospital experiences. One example was I09, a patient who traveled from out of state to be treated at the She only knew of one other person in her home with the same diagnosis, and was excited at the prospect of talking with others like her. S233, also a patient, said she would be willing to share about her hospital experience with another patient like herself. "I will just talk about my stay and learn about hers/his." I10, another patient, wanted to ask about others' health progress and hospital stay, providing support to those who someone to listen to them:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What kinds of things would you want to ask patients]? I10: How they're feeling and was it hard. And what they</head><p>going through.</p><p>Beyond sharing information about general hospital participants in both studies were compelled to offer comfort to others who go through difficult times. I12, a patient diagnosed with epilepsy, offered support to other struggling to manage the resulting emotional of having this condition:</p><p>I would say that it's okay to have epilepsy, even though you might feel like the odd one out, you could still be a perfect in your own way. -I12, Patient like this were especially evident among survey Phrases such as "don't be afraid", "stay calm", "be strong" were frequent. Many respondents wrote messages that encouraged self-advocacy, including advice be persistent when following up with healthcare providers, know their rights to request or turn down additional tests if needed, and to speak up when they feel uncomfortable. Others acknowledged and sympathized the emotional impact of a stressful hospital visit:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>It's easy to feel unimportant to your doctors, especially when requests not being acknowledged. Be your own advocate. -S89, Patient</head><p>of the patient's is uncertain, both and caregiver can feel increased tension, anxiety, stress. By forming strong connections and offering reassurance, these individuals can find a way to relieve their emotional burdens with others who have gone through the difficult situations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time in the Hospital</head><p>During a typical hospital stay, patients and caregivers spend stretches of time waiting for a provider to visit their anticipating a procedure, or recovering from treatment. Patients who responded to our survey and in interviews discussed advice about how to fill time and prevent boredom. As I04 told us, a hospital, it's not exactly Disney World." One of our interview participants, I11, was interested in finding out information from patients who have more hospital than herself: The combination of survey and interview results gave us a understanding of the informational and emotional support that hospitalized patients and caregivers need.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">other</formula><p>the interviews with our 15 participants, we also explored their perspectives about using a hospital-based support system. Although all participants expressed some level of interest in such a system, they also brought up concerns, which we discuss in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>vs. Asynchronous Communication</head><p>During our interviews, we asked participants how they would prefer to communicate with other patients and Several individuals wanted to interact with one more of their peers in real time, because it was thought to be a more personal, private, and effective method of Although some patients struggled to why this real-time connection was important to it was particularly evident among patients who were in connecting with others experiencing similar issues to share relevant information: Would you want <ref type="bibr">[communication]</ref>  feeling nervous about reading potentially negative experiences, most interview participants still it was important to know this information. one pediatric patient preferred avoiding messages other patients that might cause anxiety or sadness: I wouldn't want to see that.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interviewer: […] How come?</head><p>I01: I don't know. Some of them are pretty sad.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>You don't want to see the bad [stories]?</head><p>No.</p><p>information was also viewed as better suited for discussion with a healthcare provider instead of with another patient. For example, I04 was a patient who already comfortable speaking up and asking her doctor so advice from other patients on doing these was not useful to her. I02, another pediatric told us that patients should not discuss unexpected problems with other patients, but rather with their providers or caregivers, "because they would probably what [the] symptoms could be or any treatment or medicine you're getting."</p><p>Maintaining privacy was extremely valuable for caregivers. During their interviews, I14 and I15 expressed unease the ability for their peers to identify them through interactions. I14, who was initially not interested in information with peers, described his hesitation to communicate with other parents:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I mean you run into people in the elevators grabbing coffee if you feel like it you socialize, but if don't, you just don't, right? Yeah, I would stay anonymous. Personally, I -I14, Caregiver</head><p>Later in the interview, however, I14 said he was more agreeable to anonymously engaging with content caregivers. I15 also positively responded to the idea anonymous interactions because it would allow people to disclose information about medications or treatments without the risk of being identified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>These differing opinions about how and what to</head><p>with other patients begin to reveal the unique challenges that a hospital environment presents to designers of a peer support system. In the following section, we opportunities and examine these challenges in more</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Our research builds on previous findings that the patients and caregivers take on during their hospital their degree of involvement in activities related to care, as well as their unsupported informational and emotional needs <ref type="bibr">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">34,</ref><ref type="bibr">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">41]</ref>. The results from our studies, surveys and semi-structured interviews, the specific informational and emotional needs that hospitalized individuals are willing to exchange with their peers.</p><p>Based on these findings, we describe three design considerations for a hospital-based peer support system: (1) leveraging the Electronic Health Record to match peers, (2) protecting privacy and anonymity, and (3) accommodating interactions and needs.</p><p>In the following sections, we also briefly compare two tools used for peer support, to demonstrate how systems can adopt their benefits and improve their limitations. The first, PatientsLikeMe, is an community that offers a place for patients and caregivers to share experiential knowledge among</p><p>The second, Facebook, is a social media site that allows people to form groups about various health topics.</p><p>these examples were chosen due to their recognition and previous research, we acknowledge that other technologies are currently used for the same reasons are relevant to this work.</p><p>the Electronic Health Record to Match Peers of our survey respondents and interview participants desired an open dialogue with their peers, with those who had similar health and hospital Properly aligning the interests and common attributes of peers is critical when forming quality and can be difficult to accomplish with existing tools. Facebook users must spend time seeking other individuals and groups related their interests; the user sometimes may not know of or have access to a group, unless they receive an invitation from another group member. PatientsLikeMe forums are by chronic illness diagnosis, so those with similar across diagnoses may be harder to identify.</p><p>on how to improve this process and match peers is ongoing. For example, Hartzler et al. have profiles and posts extracted from online health to optimize peer mentor recommendations In conjunction with solutions like this, a hospitalpeer support system can leverage information from Electronic Health Record (EHR) to successfully match with each other. Age, diagnosis, medications, procedures, treatment plans, and current physical location the hospital are all examples of information stored with the EHR. Thus, it would be possible to quickly match individuals who are interested in connecting with peers their hospital stay by identifying their similar across these dimensions. One of our interview participants, I04, said she wanted to use a peer system that would help her find other patients of doctors specialized in treating her rare condition, so she could to them in detail about the quality of care and in treatment protocols across providers. A system using information from the EHR could accomplish by identifying groups of patients with the same healthcare provider, or hospital unit, who have indicated an interest in connecting with peers. This would facilitate the exchange of expertise that I04 can use to further engage in her care.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protecting Privacy and Anonymity</head><p>People have varying opinions on privacy and anonymity, as well as a range of preferences for sharing their personal information. Success of a system used in a hospital is dependent on supporting these preferences. Most our interview participants were comfortable sharing their with others, but a few specifically mentioned desire to only interact with a peer system anonymously. These individuals are interested in the of learning from other patients and caregivers sharing their own information; I15 also thought that having the option of anonymity would increase the value of support by allowing peers to express more honest about their hospital experiences. Although existing like Facebook have the option for health-related groups to be closed or open to the public, there is currently way for users to interact with these groups anonymously.</p><p>To be sensitive to individual preferences for sharing and potentially identifiable health information, a system should use an opt-in model, rather than opt-out. Users must be informed about the of sharing their information with others, and for situations that result in potentially negative should also be incorporated. Possible solutions can involve the system different levels of anonymity, customizable user profiles, icons to represent such as health status or hospital (e.g., surgical, oncology, transplant), so the user choose what information they are willing to share with others. At present, Facebook incorporates selective sharing preferences, allows users to choose audience has access to information such as birth or phone number. Having flexible security settings like Facebook helps to accommodate the broad range of that might also change over time, as patients and caregivers become more familiar with their peers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dynamic Interactions and Needs</head><p>findings from our interview participants demonstrated need to support many levels of engagement in a hospitalpeer support system. Patients like I02 and I12 valued interactions with their peers, while others like I11 I15 preferred to read content at their own time or interact with others in an asynchronous manner. results also demonstrated a variety of peer support about the patients' health, the hospital, and emotional Facilitating this support while recognizing that these needs can change over the course of a hospital stay is also important. For example, a patient might need information from peers about what to expect before a procedure, or what potential errors they need to watch for. After diagnosis or treatment, this patient might want to seek share emotional support. During recovery, while the rests and waits for follow-up care, information about how to pass the time and hasten discharge might take</p><p>We saw these changing needs among our study participants; I07 described wanting to know information and potential problems about his transplant, and S212 encouraged others to ask before undergoing a procedure. I12 was compelled to exchange emotional support after his recent epilepsy treatment. Following their surgical procedures, and I04 wanted advice from peers how to minimize boredom while confined to their hospital room.</p><p>Although some research on cancer patients have also noted information needs over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11]</ref>, such dynamism isn't typically considered by peer tools. To support these various levels of interaction and peer support needs, have emphasized the importance of designing passive and active involvement in a system <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[32]</ref>.</p><p>PatientsLikeMe and Facebook users can communicate synchronously or asynchronously via private messaging and timeline posts, finding relevant and accurate across many resources and at different points of care process poses many challenges. Prior work has also the use of virtual spaces where patients can access a repository of advice organized by symptom, treatment, or struggle <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr">49]</ref>. However, the cognitive and effort required to navigate and find relevant support is something that patients and caregivers in the hospital are not always not capable of due to medications or <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[39]</ref>. In addition, such mappings by medical as symptoms-neglect the important dynamism during a hospital stay.</p><p>Providing synchronous features like text or video chat, coupled with a knowledge base to be accessed when would be particularly beneficial for hospitalized individuals. Users in the hospital could have option of connecting with other patients currently in the or reading and contributing information to a base of patient and caregiver expertise. who were previously hospitalized and wanted to share their experiences could also add information by responding to a questionnaire after discharge. Allowing for multiple modes of interaction could increase the peer available to current patients, while supporting preferences for engaging in the system.</p><p>to peer support needs as they change over time, reducing the user burden for finding relevant support other critical components of a peer support system in hospital environment. One way to accomplish this adaptation would be to have a user answer a series of such as "do you want to learn from others about upcoming procedure?" or "do you feel like playing a with someone?" Based on their responses, the user be automatically referred to the appropriate resource information or emotional support. EHR data about medications, or procedures could be another way to direct the individual to appropriate peer information. This may reduce the burden for patients and caregivers to search for information on their own, across thousands of existing platforms. Topics or people of interest to the user could also be featured prominently within a tool and easy navigation. A patient should be able to search, and organize information from their peers in a simple efficient way. The type of content displayed could be based on their mood, health status, or current of their hospital stay. This capability would let like I01, who only want to see positive from other similar patients, avoid finding patient stories and still participate in other aspects of the peer support system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>Our work provides new perspectives and opportunities for peer support in a hospital but we also recognize the limitations of our studies. Because our survey purposefully people who had experienced an undesirable event, safety issues naturally their advice to peers. Both studies were conducted at a single pediatric hospital in an urban setting in the United States, and might not account for the perspectives a rural or communityhospital based population. Therefore, an important next step be to validate these findings at different hospitals and regions. In the future, we also would like to the opinions of healthcare providers, to explore their perspective and possible interaction with such a hospitalbased peer support system. Additionally, future work understand how the use of this system may affects engagement in their care.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>In this we explore the possibility of a hospital-based support system. Our survey with pediatric patients and offered insight into hospital safety, patient and the opportunities for a peer support in hospital setting. Through semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients, and their reactions to feature cards aspects of a peer system, we examined the specific informational and emotional needs that a hospitalsystem should support.</p><p>We conclude that supporting the specific needs and values of hospitalized individuals is essential for the success of a hospital-based peer support system. More research is to understand how existing peer support tools do, or not, meet these needs. Existing non-hospital-based as PatientsLikeMe and Facebook-have components of useful features for this patient population, including synchronous or asynchronous communication options, and customizable privacy settings. However, the environment presents additional design and considerations.</p><p>A future hospital-based peer support system should consist</p><p>(1) leveraging of EHR data for high-quality peer and tailored content for users, (2) allowing for optprivacy preferences of individuals who prefer to share or hide their personal health information, (3) providing asynchronous, active, and passive interaction, and (4) accommodating informational and emotional needs that are likely to change over the course of a hospital stay, ensuring the support is accessible without increasing user burden. Our design considerations should help guide technological systems and maximize the benefits of peer support networks for hospitalized patients and caregivers. Ultimately, such peer support could lead to increased engagement, and safety for these individuals.</p></div>			</div>
