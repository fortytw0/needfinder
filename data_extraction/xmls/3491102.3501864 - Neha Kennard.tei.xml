<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Obesity is a population-wide public health concern as it confers a higher risk of developing chronic diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, but may be mitigated for individuals as even modest weight loss (3-5% of overall bodyweight) can have a beneficial effect on health <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. The most effective weight loss interventions include frequent in-person contact with a health practitioner who provides individualized goals and strategies to support individuals to change their behaviors (e.g., improving diet quality and increasing physical activity), and to sustain those changes over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5]</ref>.</p><p>One model of providing behaviour change interventions that has gained momentum in recent years is health coaching. Health coaching is a relatively new approach within healthcare, formally entering the US health care service in 2017 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref>. It is defined as: "a patient-centered approach wherein patients at least partially determine their goals, use self-discovery or active learning processes together with content education to work toward their goals, and selfmonitor behaviors to increase accountability, all within the context of an interpersonal relationship with a coach" <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref>, p 52. This broad definition positions health coaching as a humanistic, goal-oriented and health-focused partnership that supports health behavior change through a process of individual learning and empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[8]</ref>. Studies emphasize that the key element of health coaching is that the support provided is person-centered (e.g., accounting for the individual clients' preferences, needs and values <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">9]</ref>), enabled by open communication, and a strong coach-client relationship <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>. Health coaching therefore contrasts with the biomedical model of care where traditionally, the practitioner is viewed as expert, support is often directive and can be prescriptive to the patient who needs to be 'fixed' <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11]</ref>. Understanding the humanistic practice of health coaches during interventions can thus provide new insights on how to design person-centered systems to support health behaviour change.</p><p>While initial reviews of health coaching interventions have shown them to be effective in supporting behavior change and weight loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">13]</ref>, to achieve large-scale public health impact, the geographical, accessibility and economic barriers of in-person interventions must be overcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref>. Given the need to disseminate effective weight loss interventions at population level, more explorations of how technology can support the health coaching relationship are required, focusing on the ability of coaches to tailor support to user needs, balanced with cost of resources and delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Encouragingly, evidence has accrued in support of delivering health coaching interventions via technologies, or 'eHealth coaching', with effective interventions delivered by human health coaches via email, web-based video coaching, apps, and phones <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>. eHealth coaching enables real-time, personalized lifestyle support; its key processes are data collection, analysis of data, recommendations (i.e., sending the right message at the right time in the right context for the individual), as well as data security <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref>. Compared to traditional in-person coaching sessions, eHealth coaching sessions are more time-efficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref>, and more cost-efficient <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Differentiated from this, an eCoaching system can incorporate human support (e.g., a health coach using eHealth tools), an artificial intelligence (AI) agent, or a combination of these. An eCoaching system often consists of a set of programmed modules representing an artificial entity that observes and predicts a consumer's behaviors in a specific context and in a specific period <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref>. Autonomous ecoaches exhibit abilities similar to those of their human health care professionals, including sensing (listening, observing, asking questions) and learning about user's behaviors (gathering knowledge, understanding), and subsequently acting (clarifying, reasoning, advising) to provide tailored support to reach an individual's goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, in spite of including effective strategies, at times eHealth weight loss interventions do not reach the same level of effectiveness when compared with in-person interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref>. For example, athletes tended to be more engaged when their trainings are developed and remotely supervised by a human coach, compared with a more automated approach, and authors concluded that e-coaching systems should not be purely automated as human interactions support users' motivation and adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[25]</ref>. Human support has been identified as a crucial differentiating component in helping individuals adhere to, and get results from, eHealth systems for behavior change <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">26,</ref><ref type="bibr">27]</ref>. By their nature digital tools make transparent the specific health coaching activities which to date, have been described as a 'black box' <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28]</ref>. To ensure specificity, further in-depth investigations into specific eHealth coaching strategies for specific health outcomes, like weight loss are warranted.</p><p>Tailoring is one strategy to deliver content in a personalized manner that has been identified as being effective in behavior change interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">30]</ref> and specifically within weight loss interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref>. The process of tailoring has typically involved an assessment of characteristics associated with a specific health outcome, gathered by a trained interventionist, or self-administered. This information is processed by either the interventionist, or an expert system (in the case of automated computer tailoring) that uses algorithms to select content from an expert-developed database <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">35]</ref>. More recently, context-aware systems for tailoring use wearables, sensors and smartphones that enable passive data gathering to provide personalized intervention to the individual, that is sensitive to the individual's changing internal and external states <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref>. This process produces personally-relevant information, advice and behavior change techniques matched to the individual recipient, that can also be dynamic, and change across time, or in response to changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">38]</ref>. Understanding in detail what and how human eHealth coaches tailor in their interactions with participants can help us design more effective interventions and tools for weight loss -with wider implications for the design of tailored systems to support behavior change more generally.</p><p>This study aimed to understand how eHealth coaches tailor support to individuals to help them to lose weight. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine eHealth coaches and the data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Three themes reflected how coaches provided tailored support: 'Understanding the client, ' 'Adapting Support, ' and 'Navigating challenges. ' Beyond assessing specific individual factors relating to weight loss, coaches strove to build the client-coach relationship as the foundation for the tailoring process, reflective of coaching as a humanistic approach to behavior change. This led to highly adaptive interventions from the coach, which benefited the client, but it also had negative implications, highlighting the burden of providing tailored support on the coach.</p><p>The contribution of this work to HCI is threefold: first, we provide a richly defined list of all the ways in which weight loss programs are 'tailored' by eHealth coaches. Second, we build on this understanding and interrogate what it means to 'tailor' systems and interventions, drawing out empirically grounded implications for the design of person-centered coaching systems. Finally, we discuss the findings in the context of the socio-technical issues created by internet-mediated coaching relationships. We propose that in the design of tailored systems, a 'person-centered' approach to design, means we must equally consider the burden of care on the healthcare provider, as well as improving tailoring systems to promote optimal health outcomes for the individual.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Here we outline general approaches used to support individuals to lose weight and explore how technology can mediate these and discuss the potential of eHealth coaching as a person-centered approach to promote weight loss.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Understanding how technology can support weight loss</head><p>In standard lifestyle interventions, behavioral therapy is delivered face-to-face with participants by trained practitioners, to support modification of diet (e.g., to restrict calories and improve nutritional quality of meals) and to increase physical activity levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref>. Effective behavioral strategies for supporting weight loss typically include assessing the client, providing education, setting goals, enhancing the participant's autonomous motivation, discussing their beliefs and expectations, and providing guidance in using tools (e.g., tracking tools) to enhance self-regulation skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">41]</ref>. Other effective strategies include calorie counting, contact with a dietitian, and comparing participants' behavior with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref>. While these approaches are effective, there is an increasing desire to deliver interventions via eHealth technologies to reach more people in efficient, accessible, cost-effective ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>. Moreover, it has been highlighted that there is a paucity of trained professionals to deliver in-person behaviour change interventions pointing to the need for hybrid approaches, drawing on technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref>. Specific to weight loss, a meta-analysis of 88 studies demonstrated that interventions delivered using internet technologies achieved modest weight loss compared with no treatment or minimal treatment. Notably, eHealth interventions with extra features/components or technologies were more effective than standard eHealth programs, indicating increased intensity or interactivity may be important in eHealth approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref>. Other more specific features associated with effective eHealth weight loss interventions include tracking diet and exercise, remote counsellor interaction and feedback, social support, use of a structured and tailored program <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">32]</ref>.</p><p>New technologies have been designed that allow healthcare providers better access to patient information to improve care (e.g., via clinical decision support or electronic medical records) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref> and to assess and monitor patients and develop personally-relevant resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref>. A range of tools have also been used to provide support to patients, including email, videoconferencing e.g., Skype, online social support groups and blended technology-mediated interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref>. These tools can improve the frequency, quality and efficiency of support and communication, which can be synchronous (e.g., in real time) or asynchronous <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26]</ref>. Studies have investigated how the use of these technologies impacts both patients and healthcare providers <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47]</ref>, as well as health outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref>. Increasingly, chronic care is reliant on patient-generated data, sourced from apps and wearable devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49]</ref>. However, limited time and resources inhibit providers in clinical practice from fully engaging with and reviewing data collected by patients. For instance, one study found that patients with IBD were dissatisfied with feedback received from healthcare providers on their 14-day food diary <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref>. This suggests an imbalance exists in the effort put in to track behavioral aspects and the level of feedback received, indicating a role for adjunct care or more meaningful levels of feedback using technology. Moreover, most commercially available self-tracking tools have not been designed to support sharing or collaboration within or outside of the clinic visit <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51]</ref>. This potentially adds burden to the patient and health care provider, as opposed to supporting better care through technology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Developing person-centered eHealth interventions and systems</head><p>There is a widespread recognition that effective health care must provide support that is explicitly centered around the needs of the individual <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[52]</ref>. The provision of person-centered care is complicated when remote technologies or asynchronous methods of communication are used, as it can lead people to be less adherent <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>. Interviews with people who dropped out from eHealth interventions did so because of "frustrating" technology, irrelevant or incomprehensible content, prioritizing other activities, and due to a lack of face-to-face encounters <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53]</ref>. This speaks to the need for usable eHealth systems, which facilitate connection and support to meet individuals' needs.</p><p>In addition, participants have described the difficulty of making sustainable health and lifestyle changes, requiring more than health education and recommendations <ref type="bibr">[54]</ref>. Broad, 'one size fits all' interventions fail to address the unique needs, interests, and concerns of individuals, which speaks to the need for tailored intervention content <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37]</ref>. A meta-analysis found that introducing tailored feedback in internet-delivered weight loss interventions allowed for greater flexibility, convenience and time-efficiency for both health care professional and the patient, compared with in-person approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref>. However, while it is clear that tailoring can work well as a health promotion strategy, we are not quite clear precisely how it works <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref>. For example, it remains unclear both what should be tailored (i.e., course content, supporting technologies, interaction styles) and how it should be tailored (i.e., using theoretical, practical considerations).</p><p>One way of examining how tailoring works is to examine how health practitioners provide person-centered support for behaviour change in existing programs. Indeed, Kreuter et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37]</ref> stipulate that using behavior counselling in real-time is the "gold standard" approach to tailoring, and a model upon which more automated, interactive health systems can be designed. Trained health practitioners use their range of skills in a way that meets the needs of the individual client at a given time <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[55]</ref>. There is considerable diversity among health coaches in terms of background education and training <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">7]</ref> and efforts have been made to understand, define and standardize health coaching practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">28]</ref>. Understanding key elements of coaching practice, like how support can be tailored can help reveal design opportunities to support eHealth coaching.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transforming health coaching processes via technology</head><p>Much research on the design of person-centered health interventions discusses the importance of 'tailoring' programs to the needs of individual users. Examining how a person-centered intervention like health coaching is delivered online, using digital tools (eHealth coaching), can provide us with some insights. Health coaching is respectful of, and responsive to, individual patient preferences, needs and values <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref>. It is based upon behavior change principles, with patient-determined goals, and activities intended to foster self-discovery and active learning. Coaching encourages accountability for behaviors and provides relevant educational content to clients <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[56]</ref>. A job task analysis contended that health coaches follow specific steps to support clients to uncover their intrinsic motivation and help in generating and selecting solutions to fit the context of the clients' own lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[57]</ref>. Other reviews position the role of a coach as more directive, suggesting they guide clients in overcoming obstacles to motivation and monitor and evaluate change in client behaviors, providing feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref>. The empathic relationship between the coach and client has been highlighted in successful coaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21]</ref>. Successful coaching is marked by an equal, collaborative relationship and mutual trust between coach and client, coach availability and continuity of contact, as well as the provision of emotional, as well as practical support <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Previous work has showcased a tool to promote collaboration and positive patient outcomes was MAHI, a health monitoring application that assists newly diagnosed patients with diabetes to develop reflective thinking skills, scaffolded by diabetes educators <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[58]</ref>. The MAHI app significantly contributed to newly diagnosed individuals' achievement of their diabetes management goals (changing diet) and shed light on the sense making process of new habit formation when receiving a new diagnosis. More importantly, MAHI enabled individuals to adopt an Internal Locus of Control in relation to their condition, which can support sustained engagement in self-care and ultimately, attainment of positive health outcomes. More recently, Mitchell et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref> asked whether technology can ever truly replicate health coaching practice, due to its inherent 'humanness', including finding common ground and building an in-depth relationship. In their study comparing a human health coach to an automated chatbot they concluded that human coaches have advantages that may be challenging to replicate with automated systems, in line with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref> and recommended a blended approach might be preferable to retain integrity of the person-centered aspect of coaching, with the advantages of modern technologies.</p><p>eHealth coaches can remotely assess client progress through coaching apps or web-platforms or via behavior tracking apps <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>. Patient self-tracking data has been viewed as a tool to support diagnosis, personalize treatment, increase motivation and accountability, learn more about patient habits and facilitate discussion within appointments <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51]</ref>. eHealth coaches can provide feedback in synchronous consultations (e.g., via Skype or phone call) or via asynchronous text-messages, videos, or audio recordings, ensuring the delivery of timely and tailored content to the recipients' specific needs and interests, and removing irrelevant intervention content <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">60]</ref>. Asynchronous interaction, for example, focused 'requests for feedback' sent by the coach to the client, could prove particularly useful to support the long-term, multi-phase interpersonal reflection process <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[61]</ref>. Asynchronicity allows the intervention recipient to engage with the sessions at a convenient time of their choice and provides an opportunity for the counsellor to carefully select the parts of the session to focus on. These iterative interactions may help identify a set of key discussion points, leading to a more in-depth and focused face-to-face engagement to jointly interpret and discuss differences in viewpoints, while promoting shared decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[61]</ref>. This type of "reading" and responding to the client in terms of their key values and topics was found to be a key determinant of a successful eHealth coaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref>. This was also reflected in retrospective analysis of coach-participant interactions and weight loss in an online weight management intervention. Higher levels of engagement with an eHealth coach (e.g., via attendance of individual coaching sessions and interactive web-based classes) and receiving greater amounts of tailored feedback from the coach significantly predicted weight loss at 6 months follow up <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref>.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are poor levels of reporting of how tailoring strategies are employed generally in weight loss interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref> and in the health coaching literature specifically (e.g., a systematic review reported that 20% of articles had insufficient detail to judge whether coaching was patient-centered <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref>). Therefore, understanding precisely how eHealth coaches provide tailored support via technology is critical to understanding and improving intervention design, and to reveal opportunities for creating systems to support the health coaching process <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref>. In light of this our research aimed to understand: how do eHealth coaches tailor support to individuals to help them to lose weight?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">STUDY DESIGN Participants:</head><p>Nine eHealth coaches (3 women, 6 men) were recruited through Facebook and Twitter. They were eligible to take part if they: 1. supported clients in behavioral weight loss, and 2. reported using technologies to deliver coaching. Two participants were certified Health and Wellness coaches, with a psychology degree. Most coaches (N =7) had formal education in both exercise and nutrition, with the remaining two having qualification in exercise only. Four coaches were corporate employees and five were self-employed. Four eHealth coaches used social media to communicate, disseminate educational content, answer questions, set an example for, or recruit clients (including Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp, Facebook). Five used phone calls, 2 used Skype for consultations, 1 used closed FB group, all nine used email and were able to meet clients in person for consultations or exercise sessions (if geography allowed). Six coaches used specific coaching apps (e.g., Nudge) or dietary logging apps (MyFitnessPal) to communicate or gather information about the client, 2 used 'snap and send' method (clients take pictures of their meals and send them to the coach), and 1 used wearable devices to gather information about exercise levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol:</head><p>Semi-structured one-to-one interviews were conducted in-person (N =6) or via videocall (N =3), depending on whichever format best suited each participant. After reading the information sheet and signing ethical consent forms, interviews commenced. Interviews were framed around five questions (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The full Interview Schedule is also provided in Supplementary Materials A). The mean interview duration was 54.49 minutes. Interviews were recorded using Quicktime player on a MacBook Pro. Two interviews were transcribed by the first author using 'Transcribe' software by 'Wreally'. A third party transcribed the seven remaining interviews, which were checked for accuracy by the first author. Coding was paper-based, using Microsoft Excel and a virtual whiteboard 'Miro' for data management and analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology:</head><p>Reflexive Thematic analysis (TA) was chosen as a method for systematically identifying, organizing and obtaining insights into patterns of meaning across a data set <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">64]</ref>. TA was particularly appropriate for this study as it provided scope to conduct an indepth analysis of the activities undertaken by the coaches in our sample. We took a realist orientation in this study as we were attempting to understand characteristics or tasks involved in tailoring support. The interview schedule was designed to invite the health coaches to freely discuss the nature of their approach to coaching and to explore how they support individual clients. In reflexive Thematic analysis, meaning is generated through interpretation of the data, and after nine interviews, we determined that we had sufficient data to answer our research question. The data analyst was the first author.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis:</head><p>Reflexive TA was chosen as the method of analysis, as we were addressing a specific research question -'how do eHealth coaches tailor support to individuals seeking to lose weight?' and analyzed the data with this in mind [65]. We followed the six phases delineated by Braun and Clarke <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64]</ref> in the analysis. The first author conducted the analysis, with support from the third author to ensure completeness of coding and to discuss of the assumptions made in coding. The analysis commenced through a process of familiarization with the data through reading and re-reading the interviews. The next phase (initial coding) comprised a process of paper-based, open coding of aspects of the data which we perceived to be directly related to our research question. Boyatzis <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[66]</ref> suggested that a "good code" (p. 1) is one that captures the qualitative richness of the phenomenon. In light of this, we developed and modified the codes in an iterative process while working through the analysis <ref type="bibr">[65]</ref>. In phase 3, the codes were sorted into potential themes [64] using Excel spreadsheets. Memo-writing [see Supplementary materials B for an example] and discussion guided the analytic process until we were satisfied with candidate themes, ensuring that each prospective theme: 1. had a central organizing concept, 2. was distinctive and made sense independently, but also related to the other themes, and 3. related to the research question <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[64]</ref>. Phase 4 included reviewing the themes by examining the codes/quotes relating to each theme to check each one was coherent and distinct from one another <ref type="bibr">[65]</ref>. We iteratively reviewed the nature and structure of themes using a visual depiction, leading us to define the themes and write up the analysis (Phases 5 and 6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics:</head><p>The process of data analysis was conducted in a manner consistent with the American Psychological Association's ethical guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[67]</ref> and the British Psychological Society's ethical guidelines for internet-mediated research <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[68]</ref>. Ethical approval was granted in December 2017 from the University Ethics Board and the interviews were conducted between December 2017-June 2018.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RESULTS</head><p>The aim of this research was to understand how eHealth coaches tailor support to individuals seeking to lose weight. We identified three overarching themes corresponding to this aim: 'Understanding the client, ' 'Adapting Support, ' and 'Navigating challenges.' Each of these had several subthemes which provided specific insights into the practice of eHealth coaches. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides a summary of our findings.</p></div>

An initial meeting, conducted remotely or in-person, foregrounded the health coaching process and was the crucial first step in providing tailored support. An assessment took place where the coach gathered information about the client, their needs, values, weight loss goals and personal information. For example, health coaches gauged clients' specific requirements for weight loss through gaining an insight into their lifestyle information, e.g., their job, relationship status, whether they had children and whether they had any specific medical conditions which might impact upon weight loss.</p><p>"one [of] the things that happens is, [the client says] "Well I don't have time to cook healthier. I don't have time to be as physically active as I'd like to be." And often what they're really trying to say in that is, taking time to do these healthy things for me cuts into time I'd like to be using in another area of my life, and often that is with the people who are important to them or are in some way tied to that. Like, often people are, you know, working multiple jobs to make sure that they can feed their kids and having being able to juggle all of those things. . . So, it's also about helping them connect the dots and find ways to make the time that they're, in this case, the time that they're investing in these healthy changes be something that is inclusive of the other people in their lives and is also lined up with their desire to spend time with them. " (HC5)</p><p>They also considered the clients' current level of knowledge in weight loss, their need for information, psychological readiness to change and their level of motivation for behavior change, e.g., why the client wanted to lose weight, and importantly, why now. Most health coaches preferred gathering this type of personal information through conversation (with the coach note-taking). This meeting was also essential in determining whether there would be a 'good fit' between the coach and client in the coaching process, i.e., compatibility in their personalities, humor, and amicability.</p><p>"The first session is always free because it's screening and it's a chance for us to get to know each other. It's like for me as well. Do I want to take this person on as a client?" (HC8)</p><p>Health coaches also measured the clients' anthropometric information at baseline, including height, weight, and waist circumference. This was to track progress and set reasonable and realistic weight loss goals with the client. They also assessed the clients' behavioral habits, including diet, level of physical activity, as well as other key health-related factors which influence the weight loss progress, including sleep and stress levels. This assessment occurred at baseline but generally was also collected thereafter on a daily or weekly basis throughout the coaching process, to monitor the clients' progress. Some coaches used questionnaires prior to the initial consultation to gain a detailed insight into the client and </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Burden of notetaking</head><p>No work-life boundary at times their habits and life, and this form sometimes served as an impetus for conversation: "It's like, "How much do you exercise a week? Would you describe that as light, moderate or intense level of activity?" And then nutritionist, sort of, general questions about fruit and vegetable intake, eating out, those kinds of things. So, that's the surface level initial assessment and then it's more conversational, like, "What's going on right now? What's working for you? Where do you want to make change?" Those kinds of things and then we also talk about when they've made previous attempts at change and what has worked for them and those previous experiences too. " (HC5)</p><p>A supportive coach-client relationship. Beyond the initial assessment, an ongoing supportive coach-client relationship was essential in providing ongoing tailored support to clients. This relationship was founded on mutual respect, fostered open and honest two-way communication which enabled the coach to understand their client and determine their specific needs.</p><p>"If I think they are going to struggle in terms of anxiety and things, I really try and stress the fact, 'Look, I'm here to help you. You're doing something that's really worthwhile. That has a lot of value. It's going to add a lot of meaning to your life. It's going to be a lot of work. The work is where the value and the meaning comes from. If you can embrace that and run towards that instead of running away from it. I promise you, you'll be a different person in a year. "' (HC8) Good communication was cultivated through having conversations with the individual client, building rapport through having 'normal' non-health related conversations, as well as healthrelated ones. Coaches asked open questions to invite clients to share their unique experiences and paraphrased their responses back to them. Coaches related to clients in a genuine and enthusiastic manner, evoking a belief in their approach, which they felt facilitated relationship-building and cultivated a safe environment for clients to make mistakes and try again. They provided reassurance and responded to clients' input with empathy, ensuring that the challenges each client faced during their weight loss journey was recognized.</p><p>"You can put the plan out in front of them but there is still hard work involved. You get the minimum of say 10,000 steps and 30 active minutes. When you look deeper into the guidelines, you'll see that you have to exceed it in order to lose weight. To do that, they're almost uprooting their life, so a walk in the morning and a walk in the evening if possible. Most guys and women, ten hours a day can be taken up between work, kids, life in general. It's incredibly hard. " (HC6)</p><p>This foundation of openness, acceptance and trust in the coachclient relationship enabled open communication from the client, which was necessary to provide tailored support.</p><p>It was on this basis of a solid relationship that coaches worked collaboratively with each client, building the coaching relationship at each point of each contact, enabling the coach to respond in the appropriate way. In this way they gauged the level of emotional, practical and social support that they perceived each client needed at the time. For instance, if a slip up occurred, the coach might use this opportunity to learn about their client's 'triggers. ' "If somebody dropped off the bandwagon at the weekend or somebody had a big blowout. . .you'd still just be like, 'Look, I get it. It's not the end of the world.' There are some things that can be done the next time. Everyone is human, I suppose, at the end of the day. That's the kind of way we look at it. " (HC4)</p><p>Where possible, coaches provided options and emphasized personal choice, e.g., supporting the client to find a form of exercise that they personally enjoyed/ found stress-relieving and learning more about them. Coaches endeavored to understand the client deeply, so they could identify the root cause of issues in each clients' weight loss progress. From there they could support the client to reframe their negative thoughts and address the challenges that the clients experienced with specific strategies. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">"</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adapting support</head><p>Support was adapted to the individual client in numerous ways and was dependent on the information gathered by the coach both at the initial meeting and as time passed in the coaching process.</p><p>Tailoring educational content. To provide the level and detail of educational content appropriate for each individual, coaches gauged their clients' 'need for information' or the depth of knowledge they would need to provide for the client.</p><p>"The first phone call can be a bit tough and overwhelming, for some, not for everyone, but you need to make, well I need to make it as easy as possible for them" (HC2) This evolved over time and coaches determined their clients' development through talking with them about their current knowledge of behavior change for weight loss, balanced with the clients' changing motivation and goals for weight loss. Coaches simplified the weight loss process for each individual client by sifting out unnecessary information for the client. The health coach provided clear, structured and personally relevant information around healthy eating and exercising safely, breaking complex topics into understandable terms for each individual. Importantly, they controlled the pace of learning in behavior change, through closely monitoring the clients' reaction to information they provided. Providing too much information to the individual at the one time was considered 'over-coaching' and could overwhelm the client, leading to disengagement.</p><p>"Some people are ready for high-level information from the get-go and you can tell that just from chatting to them but then there are some people where just the basics are enough. If they do the basics well, they'll get huge gains and it's just not worth pitching it higher, so we just really focus on that more than anything else." (HC4) As the clients grew in knowledge over time, coaches altered their level of support to teach clients to think critically and independently as they navigated their weight loss. For example, when each client was experienced enough, coaches reflected questions back to the client to ensure that they developed the transferable skills to think critically when making future decisions about their diet and exercise after the coaching relationship ended.</p><p>"They'll ask very in-depth questions. . .rather than telling them what to do, I discuss it with them. So, I'll say back, "What do you think about it?" So, I like to educate as I go as well, rather than dictating, with the more experienced people, getting them, to challenge them and think about it a bit more, rather than just me saying it to them" (HC3) Setting individualized goals. When the client had a set weight loss goal, coaches maintained that a fixed individual calorie limit was required based on their anthropometric information and daily behaviors. However, coaches adjusted this with the client given how the client felt over time (e.g., based on their mood while on a restricted diet):</p><p>"There is input [from the client] the whole time. If it's a struggle, like if somebody is on a 1,500 kcal diet with me and we've set that as a target and say they're gonowhere and they're feeling hungry, we can bring the calories up a little bit. Then if they're not hungry anymore, that's fine. That takes away a lot of stress."</p><p>Other health coaches provided individualized calorie intake goals, macronutrient (e.g., grams of protein) or behavioral targets (palmful of high-protein food with every meal). Behavioral goals often set with their current diet and exercise levels in mind, if a person was not doing any exercise at baseline, coaches with clients to safely build up to the optimal level per national healthy guidelines. they've not been active for a while or if this is a drastic change for them. . .okay you want to aim be active at about 150 minutes at a moderate level, 120 minutes at a vigorous level every week. Well, you've been doing zero, maybe 150 minutes this week is not the right starting point for you. " (HC5) themselves. Coaches adapted how they related to each based on the client's personal characteristics (e.g., level of emotional sensitivity), demographic profile and level of progression.</p><p>was part of skill of being an experienced coach. They easily different 'hats' or 'masks' to provide the type of support that the client needs at the time:</p><p>"I think there are different personalities but that's actually a nice part of the role where you just kind of adapt yourself. It's funny, you almost have a bit of a game depending on the person. . .You might wear three or four different hats throughout the day and they whip on and whip off pretty quick. " (HC4) For instance, coaches described that a quieter or more sensitive required a more "softly-softly" approach in how the coach would address them, along with a more solid structure for behavior change, with lots of instruction. On the other hand, coaches described having to be tougher and light-hearted in how they relate to some groups, e.g., older men. As health coaches got to know clients, they began to be more finely attuned to their needs and can respond accordingly.</p><p>"Yes. I think, you know, you get to the point where you can get a sense of people. It's through micro-expressions, or body language, or sometimes you just get a sense of how someone is feeling. " (HC9) Framing intervention content. One of the advantages of one-to-one coaching was the ability to individually tailor the support to the unique needs, preferences, and goals of the client. Coaches often on clients' initial for losing weight, aligning the content of the intervention with their life priorities and values in shared decision-making process. For example, if the client was family-oriented, the coach framed goals to enable the client to exercise with their children/ at home. "It's building around the person that's in the program. That's probably the thing. If it's built around them to start with, first of all you've upped their sense of importance in the program. So it's their program, it's their ownership, it's inviting all of that into it. That's probably the most important thing because there are other types of programs that don't build it around the person, build it what I call "on top of them". So it's a complete extrinsic motivator. There is somebody holding you to it no matter what. I realize we set targets etc., and it can be some level of extrinsic motivation, but it's all done in consultation. There is input [from the client] whole time. " (HC6)</p><p>Health coaches used higher order thinking skills, such as decision-making, problem-solving and strategizing in what overarching and interim goals they would focus on with the client. This ensured that the individual client got the biggest 'win' out of their efforts. At times, this meant guiding the client to shift their focus away from diet and exercise alone to more holistic factors, like improving the quality of their sleep and stress-management, as this seen to have a subsequent impact on their eating and exercise habits and thus their weight.</p><p>"And I knew from my own experience. . that unless have the sleep right and stress down, it's very, very to go on a weight loss program. Because, obviously, when we're out of sync, and we're irritable we are not sleeping properly, and we're stressed, are then more likely to reach for the comfort foods. So you've kind of got an incongruence and it's more difficult, a lot more challenging for the person themselves to stick to their agenda, their action steps, and reach their goals, when they are suffering from poor sleep, stress and things like that from the get-go. " (HC9) technology. Coaches used technology in various ways to tailor support for weight loss. Coaches were flexible in their use of technology and often used their client's preferred communication platform, which could entail text, email, Skype, Whatsapp, Instagram or Snapchat to communicate and provide intervention content. 'Check-ins' were often conducted on these platforms to ensure the client was understanding the process and adhering to their behavior change goals. Some coaches connected with clients on their tracking app accounts (e.g., MyFitnessPal) or using custom coaching apps or platforms. This fostered as it allowed coaches to quickly address any issues or disengagement with the program. It also allowed coaches to provide details, contextual insight into progress.</p><p>"So, I was like, look the weight might be up because of what stage your menstrual cycle you're at, you might be retaining a bit water, but your waist is smaller. So, it's like they get fixated on the, maybe numerical side of things but broadened her horizons into other aspects progression that they can look and that would bring them up a bit them going with it [their then. " (HC3)</p><p>clients who had a wearable device or smartphones and were open to logging their behaviors, coaches encouraged the use of loss tracking apps to provide feedback on their behavioral data. Coaches asked clients who did not want to and Send' approach, clients to take a picture of their meals and send it on to the coach so that they could get an insight into their diet and provide tailored feedback in the moment.</p><p>"Some people track it. Some people don't. Some people track it for shorter periods of time. Some people will do a snap and send through diary, so just on a WhatsApp thread. They might just take a picture of their plate." Some coaches provided videos walking the client through their tracked data and providing personalized feedback on their diet exercise, and weight loss progress. Phone calls were perto be a useful tool to correct any misconceptions and address individual worries or frustrations, which arose over remote com-</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Navigating Personal and Professional boundaries in providing tailored</head><p>Some eHealth coaches' personal boundaries were eroded the process of providing tailored support. They discussed having 'always on' mentality, as they were contactable over a range of online platforms at any time. While using the client's preferred social media platforms fostered the coaching relationship and facilitated easier communication, providing support using their personal Snapchat or Instagram accounts meant that coaches felt obliged to return messages at any time of the day or night to ensure the client knew they were there to support them. wouldn't say there is a [work-personal life] boundary, being honest. . ..in a way I feel guilty . . .if I don't give them a response or something you know, which I know that myself is not good like, that's not something to be of and be like, 'Oh, do you know, I'm so dedicated to my job, '. . .that's not a good mindset thing for myself like, do you know?" (HC3)</p><p>Health coaches also shared experiences of having their profesboundaries tested in the process of providing tailored support.</p><p>Many coaches described 'over-delivering' on their coaching conor agreements, putting in more hours than they were paid for to enable clients to meet their desired personal goals.</p><p>"I'm limited, based on my contracted time, so some places I can only get in once a month. That's all I'm paid for so you don't want to over-deliver on services in case that contract needs to increase so if I can only this person once a month, I'll still, you know, you won't get paid for it but you'll make the effort with the individual to make sure you're still speaking to them if they need help and that kind of thing. " (HC4)</p><p>Other clients had complex mental health conditions, including eating disorders, anxiety and depression. Coaches at times felt to provide appropriate support to these clients, with only two coaches reporting having received formal psychological training. Some coaches tried to manage this by assessing at baseline whether someone was psychologically ready to take on a weight intervention.</p><p>if a person is grieving, for example, you know, a person is in a really severe depression, they may not be ready for a health coaching program. . . if they and they are not in a great place, and then they don't see the results -that can lead to frustration, and it can actually make the person feel worse, which isn't pleasant for me, as their coach, either. . . So it's really important that the person is in the right place, mentally, to even begin. " (HC9)</p><p>Managing barriers to tailoring support. Coaches also discussed other difficulties they faced daily when tailoring support. Coaches sometimes were unsure of individual clients' true level of motivation for weight loss. These did not readily engage with the coach and a lot of check-ins, instigated by the coach to ensure they on-track with their weight loss. At times, if they did not get enough informational input from certain clients, it had implications for the level of tailored support that they could provide:</p><p>"people who don't engage in the process. . . people who don't... open up the attachments on the email. . . when you don't hear anything for a few days and you log in, sometimes somebody hasn't even started. " (HC1)</p><p>Other clients had unreasonable expectations, e.g., expecting their weight loss to be consistently linear, which led to negativity and frustration that coaches often bore the brunt of. When clients were dominant, angry, negative, argumentative, or disrespectful, it posed challenge to providing tailored support as it negatively impacted the coach-client relationship.</p><p>"I mean I'm so used to people anyway, so. . .the more and more that we deal with in here its just, like to me, I'm like, it doesn't cost anything to be polite and nice and take on board what you're saying, but others [clients] literally put up a wall straight away, and you nearly feel like telling them. . .'look I don't think there's much point in you doing this, because you're literally wasting your time and you're wasting mine'" (HC2)</p><p>The demands of business also posed a challenge for eHealth coaches in providing tailored support. Particularly for selfthere was increased need to take on more clients to generate income.</p><p>"But with regard to face-to-face consultations, I don't . . if I did them, I would not get the of clients I have now. So, in half an hour consultation, I could have four or five clients replied to, so it would reduce the income for the business but also reduce my workload. So, I just went with just email on coaching. " (HC3)</p><p>This had implications for the nature of tailored support, as rememdetails about each client and their specific needs posed a substantial difficulty. Note-taking was a burden for coaches in terms of time and data management. With an increasing caseload, the coaches' own self-care increasingly became a challenge to navigate: I'm tired or if I'm stressed, that would have a huge on how effective I would be that day so I'm well aware that if I'm in a training ground on a certain day and I need to get certain things done, actually if I haven't managed myself properly, that day could be 50% of what it should be. I think the biggest challenges are more around managing myself than actually delivering. If I manage myself I can deliver. If I don't manage myself I'll under deliver. " (HC4)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head><p>Much research on the design of person-centered health interventions talks about the importance of 'tailoring' programs to the needs of individual users. The aim of this research was to understand how, specifically, eHealth coaches tailor support to individuals to help them to lose weight. Beyond assessing specific individual factors relating weight loss, coaches strove to build the client-coach relationship as foundation for providing tailored support, which was reflective of coaching as a humanistic approach to behavior change. While this led to highly adaptive interventions from the coach, which benefited the client, it also had negative implications, highlighting the burden of providing tailored support on the coach. In this section, we delineate technological approaches to health coaching, as a person-centered approach to behavior change, ing on how is conducted in the context of weight loss interventions. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents a of the findings of this work, which can be used to guide the design of tailored interventions and systems. We also interrogate what it means to 'tailor' systems and interventions, drawing out empirically grounded implications for the design of person-centered coaching systems innovation (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). we discuss the findings in the context of socio-technical created by internet-mediated coaching relationships. We that in the design of tailored systems, 'person-centered' approach design means we must equally consider the burden care on the healthcare provider, as well as improving tailoring systems to promote optimal health outcomes the individual.</p><p>Enhancing Tailoring Depth -the degree of personalization of a system or intervention first theme and the first step in providing tailored support was: 'Understanding the client. ' This involved an in-depth assessment of various variables associated with weight loss, e.g., anthropometric measurements, diet, level of physical activity, as well as other health-related factors, including sleep and stress levels. More however, was the need to have an initial synchronous conversation (either in person, or on the phone or Skype) with client, to ascertain their specific needs in the coaching process, their weight loss goals and personal information (including marital status, job, personal values, number of children). This information the nature of support that was provided, as well as the content of the intervention (e.g., framing advice differently for clients who were parents). This was also found in the study with health coaches conducted by Brandt et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref>.</p><p>was very different to how the tailoring has been historically by automated systems, e.g., via computer-tailoring, a process predominantly based on assessing theoretical determinants a target health outcome, which are mapped out and assessed, to provide personalized materials or content <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[69]</ref>. Advancements in technology mean there are now other ways to capture information and provide relevant intervention content, highlighted by a systemreview examining how eHealth weight loss interventions are tailored <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref>. This review differentiated between types of variables which form the basis for tailoring content, e.g., the theory-based determinants of a health outcome (from online platforms, webbased diaries), and also behavioral variables (generally afforded by eHealth tools such as apps, wearables, e.g., number of calories or steps taken in a day) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref>. The article highlights the potential to increase "tailoring depth" or the degree to which information is individualized, by designing tailored interventions to include types of information (both theory-based and behavioral inforto provide the basis for tailored support. Other work has highlighted the importance of context-awareness and self-learning, providing a list of seven tailoring concepts and definitions <ref type="bibr">[70]</ref>.</p><p>The current study builds on this understanding of 'tailoring depth', suggesting that beyond measuring determinants and behaviors, there are additional "human aspects" of communication that facilitate providing tailored support for weight loss. Our findings highlight the importance of a strong relational foundation to provide the basis of tailoring. It raises questions about the nature of designing tailored systems, i.e., what does it mean to 'tailor' an to the needs of users? -is it enough to provide personcontent and hope the user is receptive, or should our efforts to support meaningful behavior change go beyond this, aspiring towards integrating more of the humanistic values from coaching into person-centered design? Our findings provide a roadmap to enacting the recommendation by Kreps <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[71]</ref> who outlined that the of automated eHealth tools must be designed such that they are 'communicatively competent,' i.e., adaptive, relationally sensitive, interactive systems that share control with users through encouraging user input and are based on individual users' unique and preferences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The role of technology to facilitate human connection for enhanced tailoring</head><p>While recent research in HCI has explored the concept of au-eHealth coaching methods for food coaching with respect to chronic disease, contemplating whether the process of coaching could be automated, similar to autonomous driving vehicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[72]</ref> presents philosophical as well as pragmatic complexities. Our research suggests that the process of providing genuinely personcentered support is challenging to replicate in a purely automated manner. The findings of this study extend previous by identifying importance of using technologies to facilitate the human connection which exists between the coach and the client, which enhance the process of providing tailored support. This has highlighted before by researchers who identified that an initial meeting was crucial to a successful eHealth coaching process, laying the foundation for a supportive relationship <ref type="bibr">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">73]</ref>. For example, Brandt, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref> suggested that their eHealth coaches used tailoring as a re-engagement strategy, through providing personalized messages to clients based on their message dialogue history of their chats in eHealth tools. In contrast, the coaches in our study strove to establish a strong didactic relationship and stayed in constant contact to avoid periods of disengagement. In providing person-centered care, patient participation and involveis critical <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[52]</ref>. As with any tailoring intervention, the quality of the tailoring process depends upon appropriate and adequate information being gathered from the client over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[69]</ref>.</p><p>The advance of technology has made it easier to stay in touch and communicate, and our coaches used a range of formal (e.g., eHealth coaching apps and platforms) and informal platforms (e.g., through connecting with clients on Snapchat or Instagram) to communicate with their clients and get a sense of what is going on in their clients'</p><p>In this study, eHealth coaches discussed "everyday" topics as well as weight loss related information with clients. Finding points connection reinforced the relationship, and coaches asked open questions and stayed in regular contact to have insight into their clients' daily life experiences. This aligned with the study by <ref type="bibr">Rutjes,</ref><ref type="bibr">al.

Technology that fosters communication in the coaching relationship would be helpful for both coaches and clients, with the capacity to gather experiential, as well as behavioral information from the client. believe there is a difference in providing personalized support and providing person-centered support. Our sub-theme "a supportive coach-client relationship' enabled the coaches in our to provide highly adaptive tailored support. We believe, in keeping with the tenets of health coaching, as a person-centered approach to health behavior change, highly adaptive tailored support is benefited by a solid coach-client relationship and regular two-way communication. This enables the coach to adapt to the changing needs of the client and judiciously select from their skills Not being able to establish 'common ground' (or shared understanding between people that enable meaningful conversation) is a common challenge with automated coaching systems, e.g., in text-based coaching systems while lack of immediate feedback a barrier to coaching process <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref>. We believe that implementing the elements in this subtheme (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) in coaching systems can lead the design of more person-centered systems. However, some of these aspects are innately human which would be challenging to For example, the emotional subtlety required to practice listening or be a sounding board for a distressed client and respond accordingly may be challenging for a system, while other like finding the root cause of a problem or providing options to the client might be easier tasks to automate. Spreading out tasks can be allocated to a system and that to a health coach may be conducive to the hybrid approaches suggested by previous work Previous work has described the design of a virtual agent with empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[74]</ref> yet more recent work has discussed the challenges of even in ideal conditions, virtual agents struggle to express empathy as well as humans and with users preferring a human response <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[75]</ref>.</p><p>Tailoring as a means to providing 'good care' in Our theme 'Adapting support' demonstrates that the delivery of tailored support was highly adaptive to each individual and has advanced far beyond the traditional idea of tailoring as a commustrategy for health messaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35]</ref>. Surprisingly, we have found in our study that health coaches adapt the clients' weight loss based on their 'need for information'. While they framed nature of the advice that was provided, they also adapted how much detail the individual client was required. One of their key was to reduce ambiguity in weight loss process and scaffold the client's learning. 'Over-coaching' could occur and overwhelm a client by setting a range of complex behavior change targets too quickly. Coaches instead broke down the complex nature of behavior change by supporting small manageable steps towards loss, seeing the bigger picture, and using their expertise to strategize in behavior change and determine what goal will give the client the biggest win in terms of their health behavior change. This speaks to the contention by Mol <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[76]</ref> who stipulates that 'good is not just about predicting and improving health outcomes, but about fostering ongoing responsive relationships where health care providers and patients/ clients adapt to the complexities of the evidence provided in the individual situation, or in their case the specific needs of the client.</p><p>In their coaching practice, eHealth coaches wore a range of 'hats' adapted their manner of relating to the client, based on the persons' personality, e.g., whether they were quiet, serious, or nonadherent. This has expanded on the findings of previous qualitative research based on interviews with 9 health coaches, reported that the decision-making process of health coaches in deciding how to tailor intervention content to the individual are complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref>. Nunes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[77]</ref> proposed that systems should be with 'Human-in-the-Loop', taking into consideration human intents, emotions, psychological states, and actions gathered through sendata. Perhaps this consideration needs to be considered for all of tailored systems, not just the patient, but the provider also.</p><p>Trying to design systems that can accommodate these personas is challenging-determining someone's sense of humor, emotional sensitivity, or 'coach-client fit' is a subtle innately human process conducted by the coaches in their initial meeting. acknowledge the differences in nature of training between health coaches, but the findings of study don't necessarily align with the premise that health coaches do not diagnose, interpret or advise clients, as proposed by Wolever, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[57]</ref>. We have found the process of providing tailored support health coaches both monitored and interpreted clients' eating and exercise behaviors, as well as patterns of weight loss. They set behavioral and weight goals in consultation with clients in an autonomy-supportive manner. This was more similar to how Kreisburg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref> describe coaching, where the coach was positioned as an expert guide, who, in consultation with clients, adjusted goals. While we did not map outcomes as part of this study, previous work highlights the difference between autonomy support and directive support with respect to weight loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[56]</ref>. Having people who validate your feelings, imize control/ pressure, and provide choices and options predicted greater weight loss 18 months compared with a more authoritarian approach (e.g., someone who rewards or punishes you for your progress) <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[56]</ref>. This demonstrates the value of ensuring tailored interventions and systems are autonomy-supportive.</p><p>Coaches scaffolded clients' progress towards their goals by pacing the clients' behavior change. They strategically reduced their of guidance and encouraged the client to make decisions relating to their weight loss over time, depending on their individual progress. This suggests that within health coaching interventions, a combination of coaching approaches is sometimes required, which changes over time depending on the specific goals, needs and reof the individual. This has implications for design of systems as for instance a more level of human could be delivered to provide in the early phases of behavior change (e.g. through remote coaching consultations), and more technology-mediated approaches strategies being delivin time to move from guidance to "supportive accountability" to provide external monitoring and feedback on behavior via apps) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26]</ref>. was echoed in previous work by Mamykina et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[58]</ref> who designed a health monitoring app that supports newly people with Diabetes in developing reflective thinking skills through social interaction with diabetes educators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Considering the eHealth coach in person-centered design</head><p>is not the first time the impact of the internet on personal has been discussed in an HCI context; previously it has noted that 'work-related technologies' were linked to effectiveness, while 'non-work technologies' were linked to fun and However, 'seamless technologies, ' used for both work and non-work, break down traditional boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[78]</ref>. This work questions: 'when peoples' homes are full of work technologiescan technology be designed to help people manage boundbetween work and non-work?' In this vein, previous research has highlighted the 'modern nomadicity' of work -how we can engage with work activities across different locations based on the availability of the resources necessary to accomplishing them Moreover, differing norms and expectations of certain work cultures or organizations can impact on personal choices in the work-life balance (i.e., the desire to allow space to unwind after work without 'bringing work home') and preferences (i.e., choosing work at home to maintain a reputation in one's field in spite of competing family commitments at home) <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[80]</ref>. The expansion of the internet has also redefined traditional areas of privacy in the setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[81]</ref>. These authors set out guidelines, including not to become "friends" with clients on social media, warning of the challenges of 'dual relationships' for professional practice.</p><p>found that the use of the client's preferred platform was used as part of providing tailored support. This had personal implications for the eHealth coach in this context, in terms of their own health and wellbeing, which may not occur as much with in-person coaching practice. This flags the double edge of using social media to maintain contact with the client and tailor their support, while benefiting the client, can be detrimental for the coach. This links Nancy Baym's <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[82]</ref> concept of 'relational labor' of connection, where artists must invest a certain amount of time and energy into connecting with their audience (often via social media) for economic and social purposes, to satisfy their audiences' needs for connection and build a fan base. This time is rarely compenfor, and there appears to be a parallel in the health coaching domain. While individual health coaches may have different predisfor using technology, the use of social media to connect with clients also raises ethical and legal issues of personal privacy and permissions around data sharing.</p><p>Given the challenges in maintaining boundaries in the coaching tools that support setting clear boundaries would serve the coach, enabling better self-care, and perhaps enhanced, tailored support. The use of business phones and accounts -setting expectation that these would not be used outside of business hours, could mitigate potential erosion of work-life boundaries for eHealth coaches. Asynchronous approaches could be of benefit as where systems are designed to enable the coach to provide support during their working hours while ensuring the client also reflect and respond at a time that is convenient, e.g., gatherfeedback from intervention recipients that could be used as a discussion guide for in-person appointments <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[61]</ref>. Shared decisionmaking and agreements with clients around when contact may made outside of these hours would also be of use. Boundary is a critical part of this process and is likely to be subject to individual as well as cultural requirements. For instance, in a Chinese context, WeChat, a mobile social application was repurto mediate patient-provider interaction where it was seen to be lacking and the authors found that this personal communication channel positively contributed to healthcare experiences and outcomes, strengthened the relationship between patients and doctors, and provided patients with psychological assurance <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[83]</ref>. However, similar to our study, the authors found the patient-provider communication added to the doctor's workloads as it ate into their personal time (e.g., answering messages on breaks).</p><p>Relatedly, some, though not all, eHealth coaches had high caseloads, facilitated by the nature of internet coaching, and consequently consultations were afforded less time. This impacted both the amount of time they could allocate to clients and also their own self-management and self-care as coaches. These findings have implications for designers of eHealth interventions and health coaching professional bodies, to ensure that attention is not only paid to ensuring the safety and welfare of clients (e.g., to ensure coaches are suitably qualified and accredited), but also to that of eHealth coaches. Additional psychological training should be incorporated into health coaching training programs to ensure coaches are well-equipped in recognizing and supporting a range of clients with complex needs and can navigate referrals of clients medical specialties with appropriate clinical skills if required. Coaches must develop the capacity to recognize their own workload capacity, both its effects on the integrity and quality of coaching they provide to clients but also its impact on themselves. Self-care must be a priority for health coaches, and there are frameworks to guide these interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[84]</ref>. Person-centered design of coaching systems must also consider the perspective of the provider of these systems and promoting their wellbeing equally to that of the recipient interventions for behavior change.</p><p>Implications for Future work. We contribute a detailed sumhow in-depth tailoring occurred the context of supporting clients to lose weight (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), which can be used, adapted, and the creation of future tailored tools and interventions to promote health behavior change. We outline guidance for the design of coaching systems and interventions to enhance 'tailoring depth' -or degree of personalization and outline how to cultivate the relationship between the coach and client, while maintaining personal and professional boundaries. In the design of future sysand interventions, we hope this work will advocate for the prioritization of the wellbeing of eHealth coaches (and other health care professionals), alongside those receiving tailored interventions.</p><p>The current study has a small sample size, relative to quantitative research articles, which limits the generalizability of the findings. In reflexive Thematic analysis, meaning is generated through interpretation of the data, and the decision to stop data collection is "inescapably situated and subjective and cannot be determined (wholly) in advance of analysis" p.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[85]</ref>. Following nine in-depth interviews, we determined that we had sufficient data to our research question. While we are somewhat limited in making broad claims about eHealth coaches on the whole, this in-depth study can serve as a launchpad for future explorations in area.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Health coaching is described as a person-centered approach to behavior change; however, the specific nature of how tailored is provided via technology has not been clear; this paper has to fill that gap in relation to weight loss specifically. Three overarching themes were identified in understanding how eHealth coaches provided tailored support: 'Understanding the client, ' 'Adapting Support, ' and 'Navigating challenges.' Beyond assessing specific individual factors relating to weight loss, coaches strove to build the client-coach relationship as the foundation for the tailoring process, reflective of coaching as a humanistic approach to behavior change. This led to highly adaptive interventions from the coach, which benefited the client, but it also had negative implications, highlighting the burden of providing tailored support on the coach.</p><p>this paper, we present a detailed summary of how tailoring was conducted in this context. We interrogate what it means to 'tailor' systems and interventions, drawing out empirically grounded implications for the design of person-centered coaching systems. We that in the design of tailored systems, a 'person-centered'</p><p>to design means we must equally consider the care on the healthcare provider, as well as enhancing tailoring systems to promote optimal health outcomes for the individual.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Interview schedule</figDesc><graphic url="image-2.png" coords="5,106.75,83.69,398.52,100.89" type="bitmap" /></figure>
