<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Information extraction (IE) approaches often play a pivotal role in text analysis and require signifcant human intervention. Therefore, a deeper understanding of existing IE practices and related challenges from a human-in-the-loop perspective is warranted. In this work, we conducted semi-structured interviews in an industrial environment and analyzed the reported IE approaches and limitations. We observed that data science workers often follow an iterative task model consisting of information foraging and sensemaking loops across all the phases of an IE workfow. The task model is generalizable and captures diverse goals across these phases (e.g., data preparation, modeling, evaluation.) We found several limitations in both foraging (e.g., data exploration) and sensemaking (e.g., qualitative debugging) loops stemming from a lack of adherence to existing cognitive engineering principles. Moreover, we identifed that due to the iterative nature of an IE workfow, the requirement of provenance is often implied but rarely supported by existing systems. Based on these fndings, we discuss design implications for supporting IE workfows and future research directions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eser Kandogan</head><p>eser@megagon.ai Megagon Labs Mountain View, USA structured information is semantically well defned and enable downstream task, such as entity matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, knowledge-base creation and population <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, text summarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, via logical reasoning on the structured representation of the document. Therefore, information extraction is often the frst step in text analysis workfows. Similar to any other data science work, information extraction involves human(s) in the loop who intervene at various phases to steer the workfow. Therefore, a more systematic fnegrained characterization of the IE workfow is required to develop tools that enhance practitioners' productivity.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: A data science workfow, consisting of three highlevel phases: data preparation, model building, and model deployment <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>.</p><p>There has been a recent shift in focus from the ML and NLP community towards human-in-the-loop data science <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, focusing on productivity tools for improving user experience and data management practices for supporting task-specifc workfows. However, these tools are developed from a generic interpretation of data science workfows consisting of abstract processes, pipelines, and workfows <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). However, these phases are complex coarse-grained processes that involve a sequence of user actions to accomplish specifc tasks. For example, a data cleaning task within the data preparation phase would require the users to 1) view the data (view) 2) form a general understanding (assess), 3) defne cleaning objectives (hypothesize), 4) develop a cleaning model (pursue), and 5) evaluate the model (verify). Therefore, the phasebased coarse-grained characterization results in the development of tools that often lack crucial features to support fne-grained actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. HCI and CSCW community have explored the fnegrained details of specifc modalities such as data <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, tasks such as data wrangling <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, settings such as collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. However, these approaches don't capture the interplay among the coarsegrained phases.</p><p>In this work, we strike a balance between the two objectives as we analyze text information extraction workfows from a fnegrained task-centric viewpoint. We propose an iterative task model comprising fve tasks -view, assess, hypothesize, pursue, and verify -which is generalizable to all the phases of an IE workfow. The task model captures user actions and goals in each phase in a fnegrained manner. When observed from the lens of the sensemaking process for analyst technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, we obtain a coarse-grained view, where the task model comprises both the foraging and sensemaking loops. The iterative foraging and sensemaking loops capture how data science workers may iterate within a single-phase and across phases of an information extraction workfow.</p><p>We conducted a semi-structured interview-based study to capture fne-grained details of these workfows, where we interviewed data science workers in an industrial research lab. We focused on understanding essential elements like reasoning, motivation, and experiences as we discussed their IE practices and associated challenges. We analyzed the interviews by employing the grounded theory method <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and performed an iterative analysis to formulate the aforementioned task model for conceptualizing IE workfows. Further investigation of the participant challenges uncovered a lack of adherence to the cognitive engineering principal <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> among the tools for supporting IE workfows. Moreover, we observed that provenance, a feature missing from the existing systems as built-in support, is a crucial requirement within the iterative setting of IE workfows. Based on those observations, we distilled eight design considerations for IE tools. Contributions. Our primary contributions are as follows:</p><p>• We designed and conducted a semi-structured interview study on ten industry projects involving IE and conceptualized IE workfows from fne-and coarse-grained perspectives through qualitative analysis.</p><p>• We proposed a task-centric model that captures a fnegrained representation of phases within IE workfows while revealing the iterative nature of a phase. • We further analyzed the tasks to capture user actions corresponding to each task across all phases and concretized task-specifc limitations. • We analyzed the limitations from the perspective of cognitive engineering principals to identify key design considerations for IE tools to assist in information foraging and sensemaking. • We discussed how the adoption of the design considerations might impact the development of IE tools in supporting rapid prototyping.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Text information extraction is a specifc instance of data science work. In this section, we ground our discussion on the data science process as we review literature on analyzing work practices, conceptualization of workfows, and tool usage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Analyzing data science work practices</head><p>HCI researchers have conducted studies to analyze and assess data science work practices along various dimensions. For example, studies have been conducted to understand work practices along dimensions such as users engagement (e.g., collaborative <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82]</ref>, single user <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70]</ref>), modalities (e.g., data <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>), tools (e.g., notebook <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>), roles (e.g., with domain experts <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>), themes (e.g., interpretability <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, trust [51], explanation <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>), and goals (e.g., wrangling <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>), among others. While exploring the work practices, many of these studies considered more than one dimension. These studies have resulted in identifying the challenges faced by stakeholders, design implications for tool development, and future trends of the data science process. In this work, we focused on a specifc text analysis workfow spanning multiple phases, i.e., information extraction, in a collaborative setting within the industry and analyzed the current practices and limitations. Information extraction from text is a diverse and complex process and, within the industry setting, involves many stakeholders beyond those that actively work with data or write code, i.e., data science workers. Our work focuses on this latter group -data science workers -to build an initial understanding of how they accomplish their workfows.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Conceptualizing data science workfows</head><p>Besides analyzing the data science workfows and the associated challenges and limitations, sensemaking studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref> have been conducted to conceptualize the workfows into high-level concepts beyond just phases. For example, studies have characterized the data science workfow as a multi-phase process <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> by building upon work on the conceptualization of complex activities around data practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Researchers in HCI and CSCW have developed insights into how data science workers approach their data <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>.</p><p>Passi and Jackson examined how imposing rules impacted data science workers and described an ongoing tension over the use of algorithmic rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Pine and Liboiron further explored how data science workers formulate their rules for defning what constitutes data, representation of data in a formal repository, and their combination process <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Muller et al. explored human formative work practices in data science and proposed fve types of human interventions in relation to data and defned data as a human-infuenced entity <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Our work is inspired by these sensemaking studies and proposes a task-based model to capture the inherently iterative phases of information extraction workfows. According to this model, tasks represent fne-grained goals within a phase. We decompose the tasks into user actions to capture transitions between the tasks within a specifc phase and transition across phases. Such characterization helps us in formulating design principles for tools that can support IE as a single continuum.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Tools capturing the data science process</head><p>Users interact with multiple modalities within a data science workfow such as data, code, models. Such multi-modal interaction necessitates the usage of diferent types of tools. Data science workers use spreadsheets for exploring and manipulating data <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. The exploratory nature of data science work often requires visual analytics, for example, TensorBoard module in TensorFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. These visual analytic tools enable data scientists to understand their data set and develop models quickly. Computational notebooks (e.g., JupyterLab <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, Jupyter Notebook <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>) have become increasingly popular among data scientists for organizing data science work. Novel techniques are also being developed to help them fnd, clean, recover, and compare code in notebooks <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. There are also bespoke solutions such as Leam <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> and notebook extensions such as B2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>, Glinda <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> developed to help data science workers in various aspects. These advanced tools and features enable users to perform coordinated visualization and interactive data exploration. IE workfows necessitate the use of these tools in various phases. There are various machine learning libraries to support two fundamental tasks within IE workfows: named entity recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> and relation extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. We refer readers to existing surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> for a more complete discussion of the broader literature. In this work, we discuss how existing tools lack proper support for IE workfows and propose additional design considerations to support rapid prototyping, interactive exploration, seamless documentation, and built-in provenance.</p><p>Earlier work such as CRISP-DM <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> and ASUM-DM <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> characterized data science as an iterative multi-phase process. Recent work on managing data science workfows <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81]</ref> address challenges related to experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment within the same multi-phase framework. However, such characterization is coarse-grained and do not capture the corresponding user actions in each phase. In this work, we propose an iterative task model which generalizes to all the phases of an IE workfow and enables us to perform a fne-grained analysis of user actions within the workfow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Data Science with Human-in-the-loop</head><p>Research on data science workfows with human-in-the-loop, i.e., DaSH, have garnered signifcant interest in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59]</ref>. DaSH is a paradigm wherein human users incorporate their knowledge into and intervene at various stages of a data science workfow -from data preparation and exploration to model building and evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>. Prior work examines roles of automation in DaSH <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref> and informs design rules for related tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> through interview-based studies. Besides conducting interviews, we also examine these systems using heuristic evaluation methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> to identify usability problems in the user interface design. For example, Gerhardt-Powals's cognitive engineering principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> leverage empirical fndings from the cognitive sciences to inform the design of an interface. The principal has been widely used to evaluate human-in-the-loop interfaces in various domains such as e-commerce <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, computer-based testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, smartphone applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, among others. We focus on IE as a representative DaSH workfow due to its widespread usage in text analysis. We investigate how the cognitive engineering principals can guide the design of the corresponding human-in-the-loop IE tools and propose several design considerations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">STUDY DESIGN</head><p>The purpose of our study is to examine existing information extraction practices and identify associated limitations and potential improvement opportunities. Data science projects (including information extraction) can often take "months" to complete <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> and may involve exploring multiple approaches before a stable version with sufcient quality is developed. Given an information extraction project, we wanted to become aware of the decision-making process as data science workers reasoned over these strategies. Therefore, we opted for retrospective semi-structured interviews as our data-collection method. In particular, the study aimed at answering the following three research questions: RQ1 : What type of (a) tasks and (b) actions do users perform in various phases of an information extraction project? RQ2 : What are the challenges in accomplishing the tasks in various phases of information extraction? RQ3 : How to improve users' experiences with their current information extraction workfows?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Participants and projects</head><p>We conducted ten interviews on ten separate projects involving information extraction at Megagon Labs, an industrial research lab, with natural language processing, data management, and machine learning as the primary research areas. Megagon Labs is a subsidiary of a large holdings and conducts research and development for the other subsidiaries with worldwide businesses in stafng, human resources, travel, marketing, and other online consumer services. We interviewed 10 data science workers at Megagon Labs, one from each project -in total, the projects involved 38 collaborators with at least two collaborators per project. We asked the participants to discuss the project retrospectively, from its inception to completion. The retrospective discussion-based setting enabled the participants to discuss their strategic reconsiderations in various phases of the projects.</p><p>We interviewed six researchers, three data scientists, and one graduate student working as a research intern at Megagon Labs. Note that none of the participants were authors of the paper and did not participate in the study design and analysis process. All researchers have Ph.D. degrees in computer science with experience ranging from one to fve years in the industry. The data scientists have various degrees (BSc., MSc.) in felds such as computer science and statistics, with similar years of experience in the industry. The research intern holds a bachelor's degree in computer science and is currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student at a university focusing on natural language processing and machine learning. All of the participants had completed more than one large-scale information extraction project and are expert users of NLP/ML techniques, software, and libraries. 30% of participants were women, which compares favorably with recent estimates of 15% women in tenuretrack faculty in computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> and 20% women in data science positions worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Projects. Each project in the study involved information extraction. Information extraction was the primary task for six projects, whereas information extraction was employed upstream to facilitate the downstream tasks for the rest of the projects. Many of these projects were accepted for publication in academic conferences (N = 6), open-sourced (N = 7), and deployed in a real-world setting as part of technology transfers (N = 4). All of these projects were collaborative. We describe the projects in more detail in Section 3.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Methods of inquiry and analysis</head><p>3.2.1 Semi-structured interviews. Each of the interviews lasted about an hour. Interviews were semi-structured, starting with background questions on the participants' roles, jobs, tools, datasets, teams, daily practices, followed by in-situ and follow-up projectspecifc questions that emerged during the interview process. The frst author was the interviewer. The interviews were conducted remotely in Zoom and recorded (both audio and video) using the built-in recording feature.</p><p>Following study introduction and background inquiries, we asked the participants to describe their project. We then asked them to explain their view of the phases and tasks within their IE workfow. Based on their description, we then further discussed each phase in detail in the selected project context. We discussed various challenges related to their workfow as and when the participants mentioned those. We also asked the participants to list desirable feature enhancements for improving their IE experience. Finally, we asked the participants specifc questions on adoption, usage, and maintenance status of their projects. Before concluding the interview, we asked the participants to share any additional observations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Analysis method.</head><p>The audio recording of the interviews were transcribed using an automated transcription service. The authors further curated the transcriptions to address inconsistencies. As the interview contained discussions on diverse and complex topics, we used grounded theory method for coding and examination of concepts and relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The interviews were then codifed and analyzed using a qualitative data analysis software, Dedoose <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>.</p><p>The coding process was inductive where concepts emerged based on the data analyzed and high-level categories -such as phases, tasks, actions, operations, challenges, enhancement requests -were used to help organize overarching themes. We extracted 493 passages from the interviews with each containing one key topic sentence. As in grounded theory analysis, we started with open coding. We identifed concepts and properties, followed by axial coding, where we aimed to relate the concepts and identify the context of these relationships. All coding was done by one researcher and refned through periodic overview and discussions with other researchers. We repeatedly examined the extracted passages in the interviews to look for additional evidence and to validate and revise our emergent understanding. These iterative analyses led to a core set of 41 axial codes, which we combined into 4 selective codes. Presentation of quotes. In presenting participant responses in Sections 4, 5, and 6, we replaced or anonymized Megagon Labsspecifc terminology. Since the details of the interview were generated via an automated transcription service, we further corrected spelling and grammatical mistakes in those documents by referring to the actual recording. Therefore, the quotes presented in this paper are essentially paraphrases. Limitations. We acknowledge that our study is limited in scope, specifcally targeting information extraction in the broader landscape of natural language processing tasks, and also in sample, as they were situated in an industrial setting. Furthermore, even though the projects involved several subsidiaries of a large holdings, all participants were employed at a single company. The choice of participants inevitably impacted the observed practices due to organizational norms, policies, and infrastructures. We also acknowledge that each interview was conducted with only one collaborator per project, as such our interpretations and broad conclusions may be limited. Although data science workfows nowadays are collaborative, our study focused on individual work practices while briefy exploring collaboration in the context of project planning.</p><p>We acknowledge this limitation and propose the analysis of the collaborative aspects of IE workfows as future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Projects</head><p>We grouped the projects into four themes: entity extraction (EE), entity matching (EM), knowledge-base construction (KBC), and content generation (CG). P1. Salient fact extraction: Company Reviews (EE): four researchers and a data scientist worked to develop supervised and unsupervised techniques for identifying salient facts such as fnegrained details, about companies from a large number of reviews. Using language models such as BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, the team extracted salient facts from a dataset of fve million company reviews using about ten thousand labeled data. P2. Aspect-opinion Extraction: Hotel Reviews (EE): two researchers and a data scientist developed techniques for extracting aspect-opinion pairs from a dataset of about a million hotel reviews using only few thousand labeled reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. They leveraged BERT, fne-tuned augmented data, to extract about three million aspectopinion pairs. P3. Structured data extraction: Job Benefts (EE): a data scientist, in collaboration with a researcher, developed and compared several text extraction techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, including rule-based and deep-learning (BERT) based techniques over a dataset with about one hundred thousand company reviews to collect list of benefts provided to employees. P4. Knowledge-base creation: Product Reviews (KBC): a team of six researchers developed unsupervised methods to capture implications between opinions from user reviews using matrix factorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The resulting framework was used to extract millions of opinions from reviews across multiple domains such as hotels, restaurants, movies, and travel. P5. Knowledge-base extension: QA (KBC):. a team of fve researchers developed a system to extract millions of tuples from two real-world QA datasets, with more than 300,000 question-answer pairs, to extend the concepts within domain-specifc knowledgebases <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Given a sequence-to-sequence learning framework, the system combines distributed representations of a question and an answer to generate facts. P6. Knowledge-base population: QA and Reviews (KBC): fve researchers developed an entity set expansion method <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> for populating facts in knowledge-bases from community QA and reviews. The system used two real-world datasets on community QA (≈ 1M QA pairs) and customer reviews (&gt; 5M reviews) to populate the concepts in the knowledge-base. P7. Entity matching: Job -Candidate (EM): one researcher and a data scientist developed an entity matching solution to match job seekers to open job positions. The task was performed by combining transformers-based models and content structure-aware pooling methods. The system was validated on a synthetic dataset of fve thousand candidate profles and half a million job postings job postings <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. P8. Explainable summarization: Reviews (CG): a research team of four developed techniques for producing explainable, easyto-interpret abstractive summaries from reviews. The team utilized a sequence-to-sequence deep learning model to generate generate the restaurent summaries from 600,000 reviews of nine thousand restaurants in the Yelp dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. P9. Controllable Summarization: Reviews (CG): a team of fve researchers developed an unsupervised system for extractive opinion summarization. The system utilizes vector-quantized variational autoencoders to extract popular opinions to generate summarized text from reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The system was employed on 1.1M Tripadvisor hotel reviews. P10. Topic modeling: Article Topics (CG): two data scientists developed techniques to generate 100 news article topics from fve million user reviews of companies. They applied a deep-learning method to extract aspects and then applied LDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> over text spans to generate the article topics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">IE TASKS AND PHASES (RQ1A)</head><p>Based on participants' explanations of their projects, we divided an IE workfow into four phases: data preparation, model building, model evaluation, and deployment. Each phase consists of multiple tasks and corresponding user action(s). In this section, we frst defne the tasks and then describe each of the phases of an IE workfow in the context of these tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">The task model of IE workfows</head><p>All of the IE phases involve fve high-level tasks:</p><p>• View refers to the act of viewing data. In this work, we refer to data in its most general sense, i.e., data can be a raw dataset or derived information (e.g., extractions and their labels, evaluation metrics).  The tasks, phases, and their dynamics within an IE workfow can be explained using the notional model of sensemaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> maps the IE tasks to the loops within the model. The overall process is organized into two major loops -a foraging loop <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> and a sensemaking loop <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. The foraging loop, which involves the view task and the details on demand action corresponding to the assess task (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), enables users to form an understanding of the data. The sensemaking loop, which involves the hypothesize task and the rest of the actions in the assess tasks, helps defne semantics for the downstream tasks to be pursued. Both the loops also emerge during verifcation tasks (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> in Section 5.2). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows how both these loops emerge in all the phases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Characterization of IE phases</head><p>4.2.1 Data Preparation. The frst step in this phase is data understanding (i.e., foraging) where users view a sample of the entire dataset, often via eyeballing, to assess the data domain (e.g., subjective reviews, factual information), its structure (e.g., tabular, semi-structured), and quality (e.g., cleanliness). When users fnd inconsistencies within the dataset, they reason over methods, i.e., hypothesize, for cleaning the data. Users then pursue those methods, often selected based on experience, to transform the data into the desired format. The entire process is captured by the following participant comment: "A lot of times it'll just be opening the data by hand, seeing what's the format, and getting a sense of what kind of information is in there and based on that either write a cleaning script to process things nicely [P10]." Users may further verify the quality of the data and repeat the steps as mentioned above until the data achieves the desirable quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Model</head><p>Building. In this phase, users again view a sample of the entire dataset to identify and examine, i.e., assess, diverse and representative patterns and their distributions using methods such as clustering. One participant commented: "So I would say that the challenge is mainly in the domain, what sort of information you're interested in fnding whether it is opinions or not <ref type="bibr">[P5]</ref>." Based on their assessment users then defne pattern semantics (hypothesize). Defning pattern semantics often involves multiple collaborators who label the patterns manually, then document their observations, and iteratively refne the pattern defnitions to create a fnal rubric for extracting patterns. In the absence of ground truth labels or a benchmark, users pursue an additional process of labeled data collection. Data can be collected by assigning annotation tasks to in-house experts or crowdworkers (pursue). Once data collection is completed, users may further verify the annotation quality using qualitative (e.g., eyeball) or quantitative (e.g., annotator agreement) measures. Depending on the quality of the labeling, users may further assess the labels and redesign the annotation task based on discussion hypothesize.</p><p>After fnalizing the extraction pattern defnitions and pursuing the optional data collection step, users utilize the refned rules to create models (pursue) for extracting information from the dataset. Alternatively, users may reuse already existing models. In this stage of the workfow, users often lack an understanding of the fnal evaluation metric. So, users frst view and assess the quality of the extractions using simple measures such as error rate and support count of rules. This observation is captured by the following participant comment: ". . . we didn't always have a benchmark to begin with. The benchmarks came later, when we were fnally evaluating this ." However, if the results are not satisfactory, users may explore the results in further detail to explain the model's behavior by investigating the positive and negative examples (hypothesize). Users then update the models accordingly (pursue). These tasks are repeated until a stable version of the model is developed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Model Evaluation.</head><p>In this phase, users employ the fnalized version of the model on the entire dataset (pursue). Users then verify the model on the labeled dataset using metrics such as precision, recall, coverage, top-k extractions. By this stage, users have a better understanding of the suitable evaluation metric and their acceptable values. In this phase, users tend to evaluate the model on multiple datasets. Similar to the previous phase, based on the results users may select the current version of the model as the fnal one or perform further assessment of the model (view and assess). The assessment may result in new observations on the model behavior (hypothesize) and users augment the model accordingly (pursue). Users then again employ the model (pursue) and evaluate (verify). For example, one participant commented: ". . . at times the rules will capture the 80% of the data, but I'm really interested in modeling the remaining 20% . . . we wanted to fgure out these long tail concepts . . . We will run (model), look at the output, make a judgement of whether it is capturing the long tail, and go over again to change the rules a bit [P6]."</p><p>At frst glance, it may seem that both model building and model evaluation phases satisfy the same objective. However, model building is less restrictive and less rigorous than model evaluation. Model building is exploratory, where users operate on a small sample of data to formulate a basic understanding of the model behavior. Model evaluation, on the other hand, is confrmatory where users extrapolate their understandings on a larger scale or test the system rigorously (e.g., addressing edge cases). One participant commented: ". . . what is the quality of the things you extract? And because it fails, then you go back. You look at the examples and see, okay, so this is a noun phrase, but I don't want these noun phrases [P9]."  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). These tasks emerge within a general fow of "view-assesshypothesize-pursue-verify" in all phases of an IE workfow. Iteration can happen across phases. For example, in the aspect-opinion extraction project (P2), collaborators identifed that a collection of duplicated reviews generated by bots were impacting the model performance, which they addressed in the next iteration by employing deduplication strategies: "So if the results are not good we will do our analysis . . . we retraced back to the original reviews and found that those are bots that are sending the same reviews multiple times." Therefore, the observation triggered a transition from the deployment phase to the data understanding and preparation phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.3.2</head><p>The impact of iteration on an IE workflow. As described in Section 4.2.2 and Section 4.2.3, users often repeat the process of data collection and model evaluation to obtain a high quality ground truth and an efcient model, respectively. To construct the ground truth, users iterate over several versions of the labeled data as well metadata such pattern semantics, annotator agreement. Similarly, as users iterate over model versions they keep track of metadata related to model performance such as qualitative observations and quantitative metrics (e.g., precision, recall error rate). For example, one participant commented: "So, the crucial point being when you train the models, you will specify a lot of hyper-parameters. then we need to keep track which set of hyper-parameters resulting in what performance . . . F1 score, accuracy [P7]."</p><p>Metadata management and provenance help users assess data and models. For example, users may assess labeling performance by comparing the annotator agreement rate between subsequent iterations. Similarly, they may compare the error rate of diferent model versions. Based on the assessment users may decide to pursue next steps such as issuing new labeling task or updating existing model. We identifed several challenges related to metadata management and provenance in their existing practices, which we discuss in Section 6.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">IE TASKS AND USER ACTIONS (RQ1B)</head><p>We now characterize the user actions corresponding to the tasks across the IE phases (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). In particular, we identifed that users' IE operations map to 17 unique user actions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Characterization of user actions</head><p>5.1.1 View. Sampling and exploring data are two actions that correspond to the view task. The goal, as explained earlier, is to view data in its raw form. For example, viewing the dataset during data preparation (DP, hereafter), exploring labeled ground truth during model building (MB, hereafter), and analyzing the outputs of the models during model evaluation (ME, hereafter) and deployment (MD, hereafter). Note that the sample action is often a crucial frst step in an IE phase as it makes the information perceptually scalable to the users and help them in qualitative analysis. One participant shared their sampling experience during data preparation (DP): ". . . the dataset has more than a one million rows . . . So we had to sample a subset like 10,000 rows [P1]." View actions can be performed either programmatically (e.g., random sampling) or by direct manipulation (e.g., sampling data in a spreadsheet by scrolling.) 5.1.2 Assess. The assess task is performed in various phases to observe the presented information and ascertain interesting features or patterns. Examples include computing distributions or summaries (DP, ME), examining data corresponding to the summaries (DP, MB, ME), and comparing diversity of patterns (MB, ME, MD) (see Section 4.2). Such reconnaissance helps in hypothesis creation and decision making in subsequent steps of an IE phase. The operations corresponding to the assess task can be grouped into three high level actions: overview, details on demand, and compare. Overview: Overview action enables users to get a birds eye view of the underlying information space. The high-level information often helps in isolating errors, surfacing diverse and representative patterns, and obtaining data summaries. For example, one participant used k-means clustering to evaluate data quality (DP): ". . . we almost always end up with a cluster or two that are devoted purely to grammatical or spelling errors . . . [P10]." Besides clustering, another popular overview operation is computing distributions on various features of the data such as length of text and pattern count. These summaries help in decision making in the subsequent steps. For example, distribution of length of text in the corpus can infuence the model building decisions as mentioned by one (MB): "I want to try to understand how long texts tend to be if there is significant variety . . . that's going to signifcantly afect your model . . . that is a much harder problem than modeling texts that are all of a similar size [P3]." Details on demand: Another important action related to assessment is obtaining further details of the summary information. Seeking such details helps in confrming the observations gathered as users can understand the context of the overview by examining the raw data. For example, one participant commented how clustering helps while qualitatively evaluating models (ME): "one thing that's very common is I'll try to cluster the text that I'm looking at. Then look at a few examples from each cluster . . . And so looking at a few examples from each cluster means that hopefully I'm looking at very diverse examples . . . <ref type="bibr">[P3]</ref>." All of the operations belonging to this action class involve searching for the raw data corresponding to the overview or summary. Users perform the action in various ways such as printing samples using the grep command in bash script or print command Python. For example, one participant commented how they assessed potential extraction rules (MB): ". . . I just searched for the word (using grep) and got text preceding that word and following that word so that I don't read an entire three paragraph review. I would just read the sentence that mentions the word [P4]." Compare: Compare action enables users to compare and contrast the diverse information, for example, during model building as mentioned by one participant (MB): ". . . at that point you have to go quickly glance at each cluster and get a sense of the main topic or what sets it apart. I then see if there's a few clusters that have the same labels, maybe revisit them and try to see what diferences are there [P10]." However, the compare operation is also used to assess models across iterations using metrics such as error rate, ratio of positive and negative examples, support count of an extraction pattern (ME). For example, one participant commented: ". . . in that phase I kind of quickly do a sanity check that if the error rate matches what I recorded before and make sure the code doesn't have a bug [P4]." 5.1.3 Hypothesize. The user actions corresponding to the hypothesize task often involve multiple collaborators reasoning over subjective observations to reach consensus, e.g., defning pattern semantics, creating extraction rubric. We identifed four actions corresponding to the hypothesize task: label data, document observations, defne semantics, and create rubric. Label data: The label action involves annotating information such as raw data (MB): ". . . we start from labeling the data sets, with all of us label 1000s of sentences and we pick the top 10 that will feel the most salient from these labels we try to observe [P1]." Users also annotate outputs of models during model evaluation (ME) to characterize model behavior. Document observations: Participants documented their observations during hypothesis using handwritten (paper) or digital (spreadsheets) notes. For example, documenting potential extraction candidates with explanations during model (MB): "I'll actually try to record it down. For example, let's say if a review talks about directions and hotel, maybe my assumption was that that review is defnitely talking about asking for directions to the hotel [P4]." Similarly, to compare diferent candidate extractors, i.e., models, participants may record performance, version, and the underlying heuristic of the corresponding model (ME): "I look at 20 results and </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.2.1</head><p>The exploration-confirmation loop. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, each phase in the IE workfow has two processes -an exploratory process and a confrmatory process. The exploratory process is bottom-up, i.e., formulates semantics from data. The confrmatory process is top-down, i.e., verifes the defned semantics using evidence. Users continue to iterate over the exploratory and confrmatory processes until stable semantics for the model is defned.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">Human-in-the-loop model building.</head><p>The projects in the study can be divided into two approaches: deep-learning-based and rulebased. From an implementation standpoint, the key diference between the two approaches would be the presence (i.e., rule-based) or absence (i.e., deep-learning-based) of feature-engineering. In deep-learning-based extraction, participants employed models such as BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> trained on crowdsourced data. However, they were required to form an understanding of the data through labeling and documentation to defne the semantics of HITs. On the other hand, in rule-based projects, participants performed data reconnaissance to defne and handcraft extraction rules. While the goals of the two approaches are diferent, the underlying process remains the same where humans are involved in the loop for conceptualizing pattern semantics.</p><p>Similar sensemaking-oriented task model can be seen for defning semantics related to other phases such as model evaluation and deployment. For example, in the knowledge-base population project (P6) participants initially used precision and recall as metrics and later refned the fnal evaluation metric to be precision@k and recall@k due to the unbounded nature of the extraction sets. The underlying task model for creating the evaluation metrics were same as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>: viewing a summary of performance (view), assessing the results by examining raw data (assess), documenting data and model characteristics and defning evaluation criteria (hypothesize), creating metrics accordingly (pursue), and verifying the metrics (verify).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">IE WORKFLOW CHALLENGES (RQ2)</head><p>We now describe challenges related to various IE tasks. Lack of semantic search capabilities: Spreadsheets and bash commands (e.g., grep) lack advanced search capabilities. For example, the search and flter operations in spreadsheets are limited to exact match and don't consider semantic similarity. One participant commented: ". . . maybe some kind of fltering of synonyms . . . So for example we want to label everything with salary into benefts. There are many synonyms of salary. Especially I need to enumerate the synonyms myself . . . because Google Sheets doesn't provide that functionality [P2]." While bash commands such as grep are more expressive and support regular expression-based search, they also lack semantic search functionalities. For example, one participant requested searching by parts-of-speech tags with grep: "The only thing that I wish grep had is that . . . I would (search) delicious followed by two (placeholder) words and then a NOUN, as opposed to say, food [P4]." Direct manipulation vs. programmable search: While computational notebooks enable users to implement bespoke semantic search, they impede free-form data exploration due to a lack of direct manipulation capabilities. One participant commented:"main downside of notebooks is sometimes its harder to dig deep into the data. Because the print feld is a bit limited. And you can't do things like sorting or editing data [P10]." 6.1.2 Dificulty in sensemaking. While sensemaking is crucial for users to make informed decisions about their subsequent actions, there are several challenges with the existing set up. Difculty in qualitative validation: To qualitatively assess extractions users need to manually explore the raw data corresponding to extractions, which can be cumbersome as mentioned by one participant: ". . . the other one (recall) is a little bit more tricky, because you need to read reviews . . . once you implemented your extraction then you need to go back and see, was there something you missed? . . . I would create another notebook or program and repeatedly print out documents (reviews). That's a very bad experience [P8]. Similar observations can be found for debugging of extractions: . . . what we have to do, which is actually very tedious, is to get an extraction, go back and see where it came from. Or get sentences that didn't have extractions or suspiciously too few extractions to see if that made sense or we missed something [P10]." Labor intensive documentation: The documentation process is even more tedious and time consuming as users need to reason over the presented information and then document their observations. For example, in the structured data extraction project (P3), the participants maintained a log of the errors of rules and their explanation in Jupyter Notebook cells: "I'll copy all of the code within that cell, paste it in a cell down below it, make modifcations there to the rule, and then go through that process again." Lack of an overview interface: Due to the lack of a built-in overview interface that conveys diverse and representative information, participants faced difculty in comprehending the information space and often resorted to creating custom features to obtain overviews or summaries from the data. One participant commented: ". . . what we need right now is a visualization UI. So we hope that there will be like a visualization ready for us to for example, help us draw key features to analyze prediction results [P1]." Another participant requested: ". . . a clustering process that's part of the labeling process that you can label the most important examples instead of just labeling random things [P3]." Providing interactive feedback: Participants also requested automated mechanisms for focusing their attention during the sensemaking process. For example, one participant requested an alerting feature to inform data quality issues after annotation by crowdworkers or experts: ". . . there is a control board that shows me all these statistics and sends me alerts. For example, annotation alerts that with these we were not able to train a (quality) model [P8]."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Challenges of performing IE tasks</head><p>The same participant requested automated notifcation on negative model performance: ". . . notify training model doesn't converge. It will defnitely make my life easier [P8]." Facilitating comparison: Another important action within the sensemaking process is comparison such as comparing model performance or impact of diferent parameter settings. One participant commented: ". . . say we have 10 diferent models. And then I'm pretty sure I like to like do analysis in an interactive manner, so that I can pick up the best model for the purpose. Otherwise, I think it'd be time consuming see 10 diferent outputs to from the result fle [P9]." Participants also requested what-if style dashboard (similar to LIT <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>) to perform counterfactual analysis: ". . . a table where I have some columns that could be used as parameters, and then I have the true label and the predicted label as two columns. Then that would be all you need to feed into (a system) that outputs a plot where you can select and parameters and their values and see how the metrics change [P10]." 6.1.3 Dificulty in "pursue" tasks: The challenges related to the pursue task are often action specifc such as labeling, augmenting models.</p><p>Labeling and cognitive burden: The labeling of data often puts cognitive burden on the users as mentioned by one participant: "So it was fairly labor intensive labeling. I would end up spending a full 30 seconds to minute on each entry so it wasn't very efcient [P10]." While there are various solution now available to make labeling easier, they often do not capture the entire spectrum of labeling requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In multiple projects (P2, P8, P9, P10), participants had to perform bespoke labeling tasks that were not supported by existing tools. No-code/low-code model confguration: While reusing a model, participants requested GUI-based features to confgure model parameters, inputs, and outputs. One participant commented: "I can just do some very high level confguration that doesn't require any understanding of the code structure. I say column A is the input, column B is the classifer output and then do all the work without writing the code [P8]." Participants even created custom wrappers to models for confguring parameters. For example, one participant implemented a parameterized search function over a bash command: "For some projects I was doing this (grep) so much that I created aliases in the shell script to search with parameters like fetch delicious and food with words in between . . . I didn't want to type that long regex command which is about the spaces in between. So if there was only something that would do that (automatically) [P4]."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Challenges related to iteration</head><p>From the interviews, we identifed several challenges related to metadata management and provenance that participants experienced to keep track of both task outcomes and data across iterations. We also observed challenges in context switching due the iterative nature of IE workfows.</p><p>6.2.1 Bespoke provenance management. Users often manually created data provenance mechanisms to keep track of data across iterations. Integrating provenance practices in the IE workfow enables users to explore the lineage of data, extractions, and models. For example, one participant commented: "So basically every step of the extraction we just append new information to the reviews . . . aspect and opinions. we keep track of which tokens are these aspects coming from? also the character ID, the token ID, sentence ID. This is something that we developed manually [P4]." Therefore, the onus is on the user to integrate provenance measures. Absence of a measure can lead to loss of information, which can hamper the IE task as captured by the following participant comment: "I never recorded the sample. Later, when there was a mistake, I could not fnd it (the samples), because I was not sure which slice of the data I got it from. . . . because random sampling doesn't produce the same seed, it doesn't give me the same instances [P4]." 6.2.2 Cumbersome experiment tracking. Metadata can be both quantitative and qualitative. To track quantitative metadata (e.g., metrics, parameters) related to their pursued actions, users employ various strategies such as naming result fles with tags related to various metadata. One participant commented: "I tend to be very verbose in my fle names and essentially include almost every parameter that went into training, ends up expressed in the flename . . . And that becomes really cumbersome to keep track of [P5]." Another participant created separate log fles for each iteration and added the logs in a spreadsheet: "after I fnish (model building) at that point I'll be in Google Sheets, and I'll have essentially a separate sheet for each iteration, and then I'll generally have a single master sheet at the beginning, that has a summary data statistics and parameters for each of the sheets comprising the fle [P10]." 6.2.3 Labor intensive metadata tracking. Tracking qualitative metadata (e.g., user comments, documentation) can be an even more tedious experience as these are often verbose comments or documents shared among collaborators. For example, in structured data extraction project (P3), the users maintained a log of the errors of rules and their explanation in jupyter notebook cells, one cell for each rule version. The participant commented: "(For each rule version) I will document the examples that were wrong grouped by the reason for why each one was wrong. Once I'm done with the process, I essentially have N versions of the rule. And I can look at why and where each version the rule failed. So that I can easily understand the provenance of the rule and how and why I made improvements." 6.2.4 Tedious context switching. Participants employed various tools such as spreadsheets, computational notebooks, and bash commands, for completing their tasks. However, each tool has usage across tasks. For example, spreadsheets were used for viewing data (view), labeling patterns (hypothesize), preparing/cleaning sample data (pursue). Computational notebooks were used across all the tasks. Bash commands were used for viewing sample data (view), regular expression-based search and running models (pursue). Since both the phases and tasks are iterative, users were often forced to move back and forth between multiple tools as they accomplished their IE workfow, which can be cumbersome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR IE TOOLS (RQ3)</head><p>In this section, we distill several design consideration for supporting human-in-the-loop IE workfows based on the observed challenges. We discuss the design considerations at both feature-and systemlevel. We situate our discussion in the context of Gerhardt-Powals's cognitive engineering principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, a widely used heuristic evaluation method for evaluating human-in-the-loop interfaces (see Section 2.4).</p><p>Cognitive engineering principles. We focus on the following principles: automating unwanted workload (CP1), reducing uncertainty of information (CP2), fusing data to provide high level abstraction (CP3), using known metaphors for ease of interpretation (CP4), displaying information in a logical manner (CP6), providing visual aids during information seeking (CP7), maintaining context of current focus (CP8), and presenting information at multiple levels of detail (CP9). Of the two remaining principals, one principal promotes context-dependant naming of actions, which is observed by any standard systems nowadays. The other principal on judicious redundancy is related to the design and organization of interface components, which is beyond scope of this discussion.</p><p>7.1 Feature-level considerations D1. Facilitate advanced search capabilities: Search and flter operations help focus a user's attention to information being explored (CP8). An IE tool should support typical semantic search functionalities -e.g., search by synonyms, POS tags, regular expressions -as defaults (CP4). Besides programmatic specifcation (e.g., python script), users should be able to specify these operations either via direct manipulation, e.g., a menu bar (CP1). For example, TextEdit <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> is a wrapper for Pandas dataframe <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> that enables users to programmantically perform semantic search. D2. Provide interactive feedback: Interactive feedback can help in improving trustworthiness of a user action while focusing user attention to the desired information (CP2, CP8). Participants requested interactive feedback for various user actions across tasks for highlighting information (in overview, details on demand actions) and conveying updates or alerts (in validate and evaluate actions). Feedback should be automatically provided as visual aids using known metaphors such as color highlight (CP1, CP4, CP7).</p><p>D3. Generate automated summary: Overview interfaces are extremely popular in the information visualization domainoverviews make the information space perceptually scalable thus reducing cognitive burden of users <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Viewing the information at multiple levels of detail, i.e., summary and raw data, also provides more context to the users (CP3, CP9). The grouping within the overviews should be constructed automatically and should convey information in a meaningful (e.g., clustering text by semantic similarity) and a visually consistent manner (CP1, CP6, CP7). D4. Provide means for comparison: Comparison actions are fairly common while assessing data and models. However, comparison operations often lead to visual discontinuity of the information being explored leading to users loosing context of their task <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72]</ref>.</p><p>The comparison feature should automatically convey comparative information meaningfully with visual aids, to enable informed decision making (CP1, CP6). Moreover, information should be conveyed at multiple levels of detail to add validity and reduce uncertainty (CP2, CP9). For example, highlighting diference between model performance across iterations via both charts and tables. D5. Ensure ease of hypothesis creation: Hypothesize actions such as labeling and documentation are crucial for sensemaking and happen in a collaborative setting. As these actions are labor intensive, an IE tool should automate the process, for example, via recommendation of potential labels, explanations, metrics (CP1). Both labeling and documentation should be integrated as default features within any IE tool (CP9). D6. Enable confgurable actions: While not as common as the previous features, confgurable pursue actions (e.g., tuning models parameters) still have their benefts. Confgurable user actions should be designed in a way such that unwanted workload of users are reduced (CP1). IE systems should introduce the "confgurability" feature wherever appropriate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">System-level considerations</head><p>The system-level considerations are based on our observation of usage of tools across IE tasks and iterations. Users employ various tools to accomplish their goals -spreadsheets and bash commands for data exploration and preparation, computational notebooks and scripts for both model development and data exploration. However, none of these tools capture IE phases within a single continuum and users need to move back and forth between multiple tools which can be tedious. As mentioned earlier, while provenance and metadata management across iterations are crucial to IE, existing solutions lack built-in mechanisms to support such iterative process. D7. Reduce context switching: Context switching is an unwanted workload that puts cognitive burden on the users and leads to loss of context <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72]</ref>. One approach to reducing context switching between tools to design a system that groups multiple views related to an IE process, i.e., data view, summary view, script/code view (CP1, CP9). For example, Leam <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, a general-purpose text analysis tool combines a spreadsheet, a code editor, and an interactive visualization pane to support integrated text analysis. However, a crucial requirement for such a system should be supporting metaphors that are already known to the users. Therefore, instead of developing a new solution, a better approach is to infuse those metaphors into existing solutions (CP4). For example, enhancing D8. Support for provenance: As discussed in Section 6.2, IE workfows are iterative and require integration of provenance and metadata-management practices for ease of assessment and hypothesis. Therefore, features that enable automated provenance and metadata management should be promoted as frst-class citizen of any IE system (CP1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">DISCUSSION</head><p>We now discuss the implications of the task model and our proposed design considerations for developing IE tools. IE as a continuum: enhancement vs. creation. The notional model of IE tasks is inherently iterative and often requires users to make transitions to diferent phases or tasks on-demand, thus necessitating context switching between tools. The system-level design consideration (D1), outlined in Section 7.2, recommends that an IE tool should reduce such context switching to reduce cognitive burdens of the users. One possible approach is capturing the modalities -data, charts/summaries, code -within a single continuous process. Recent eforts in such combination have resulted in either creation of bespoke tools (e.g., Leam <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>) or enhancements (e.g., B2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>, Lux <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>). These bespoke solutions often ofer new interactions but are not feature-complete. Therefore, they sufer from a lack of adoption. Enhancements, on the other hand, often capture a subset of the modalities and requirements. However, iterative enhancement focusing on capturing the end-to-end process and the complete set of features ofers more promise. In fact, Xin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref> identifed the self-sufcient end-to-end workfow support as a crucial factor in ease-of-use and efciency of human-in-the-loop AutoML platforms.</p><p>Iterative planning and collaboration: a creative design perspective. A common theme across the projects is iterative hypothesis creation along multiple threads, such as model refnement and concretization of an evaluation metric. The hypothesize tasks are collaborative and are crucial for defning the action items for the subsequent pursue task. To this end, the hypothesize task is similar to the creative design tasks (e.g., web design <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>), which also involves such iterative planning and collaboration. Stakeholders of the design task create and share unstructured documentation of requirements updated both synchronously and asynchronously. The documentations are then distilled into actionable plans either manually <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> or semi-automatically <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Throughout the task, stakeholders iterate over the plan. Similarly, the hypothesize task in IE contributes to iterative formation of rubrics such as extraction</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">✓ - - ✓ - ✓ - ✓ ✓ - - ✓ ✓ - ✓ - ✓ ✓ - ✓ - - - ✓ - - - - - ✓ - - - ✓ - - - - -</formula><p>rules and evaluation metrics. Several approaches for model documentation (e.g., Factsheets <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and Model Cards <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>) and data documentation (e.g., Datasheets <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and Nutrition Labels <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>) have been proposed to be used as checklists to ensure the quality of models and data. However, recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82]</ref> argue for greater standardization around documentation to record discussions and decisions made within data science workfows. Moreover, within a collaborative environment, where team members co-ideate and deliberate, any computer-mediated solution may be vulnerable to confict and misunderstanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77]</ref>. To ensure ease of hypothesis, as recommended by design consideration D5, a better understanding of the pain points of such a human-in-the-loop process is crucial.</p><p>Maintenance and reproducibility: an afterthought or a necessity? Throughout various sections of the paper, we discussed how provenance and metadata management are required for reproducibility of IE workfow and efective monitoring and governance of data and models. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> identifed lack of provenance as a contributing factor in obfuscation and loss of knowledge when data science teams share data. As outlined in our design consideration, D8, provenance and metadata management should be promoted as a frst-class requirement of any information extraction tool. One approach can be to instill MLOps <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> practices by integrating suitable platforms with the tool. However, MLOps practices are designed to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efciently. Therefore, further research is required to identify ways to integrate such practices into research environments, which can be highly experimental and more iterative than production environments. Human agency vs. automation. A key feature in all of the design considerations discussed in Section 7 was automating unwanted workload, one of the design principles of cognitive engineering. However, the tension between human agency and automation is long-discussed in HCI research <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> and poses vital challenges for designing and engineering data science platforms. How can we efectively integrate automated reasoning into interactive systems without impeding human agency? Recent work exploring human-AI collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> argues that a completely automated process may impede a data science worker's deep understanding of the data and models. They envision an augmented data science environment where data scientists, in collaboration with subject matter experts, steer automated agents to produce outputs that satisfy business goals. This viewpoint aligns with mixed-initiative systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> that aim to ofer the best of both worlds with principles on when an automated agent should proactively take action and when a user should. Therefore, a more in-depth investigation of approaches to reconciling agency and automation is required as the design considerations are incorporated into IE systems.</p><p>Broader implication of the task model. While we derived the task model based on grounded theory-based analysis of IE workfow practices, it is not clear whether the task model generalizes to any data science workfow. There are similarities between the phases of a typical data science workfow and our observed IE workfow. However, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> there may be additional operations and modeling requirements depending on the task at hand. Moreover, as mentioned in Section 2.1, data science workfows may involve stakeholders beyond data scientists, e.g., product managers. Besides exploring the generalizability of the task model, a deeper investigation of various tasks is thus required. For example, tasks such as assess and verify are often associated with trust and interpretability in data science. <ref type="bibr">Passi and Jackson [51]</ref> argued that the perceived value of the quantitative metrics of assessment and verifcation may vary across stakeholders. Therefore, understanding how to work with such plastic nature of quantifed trust is crucial when designing trustworthy systems involving multiple stakeholders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we presented a semi-structured interview-based study to understand IE work practices and observed an iterative fnegrained task model that emerged across all the phases. We identifed several challenges with the existing IE workfows and proposed a set of design considerations, based on cognitive engineering principals, for developing human-in-the-loop IE tools. The design principals may the development of future tools and help identify enhancement opportunities within existing systems. Therefore, an immediate next step is to operationalize the principals within popular data science environments such as computational notebooks and conduct large-scale studies to evaluate their efectiveness. Moreover, the study can be extended to understand the role of collaboration in the task model and characterize the pain points related to aspects documentation, hypothesis formulation, and confict resolution. Finally, additional studies can be conducted to understand the broader implication of the task model along dimensions such as generalizability, trust, and interpretability within the human-inthe-loop data science setting.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>•</head><label></label><figDesc>Assess refers to the act of reconnaissance over the presented information, for example, examining data distribution, fnding interesting patterns. • Hypothesize refers to the act of reasoning over the observations to defne model semantics. • Pursue refers to the act of actualizing the hypothesized model over the data.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_3"><head>4. 2 . 4</head><label>24</label><figDesc>Deployment. In an industry setting, deployment involves putting the fnalized model into production (pursue). However, publication of a model in an academic setting is also quite similar where creators open-source their code or models for others to reproduce the solution. However, users need to monitor the performance of the deployed model continuously. The model performance may degrade for a new dataset or due to concept drift in existing data domain. As a result, the users may again repeat tasks such as verify, assess, and hypothesize to update the model. One participant commented: "I've set up a dashboard with a number of plots . . . ratio of positive and negative examples, distribution of extractions . . . that monitoring is very important. when the data requirement changes (for the application) that's not going to be explicit. So you need to be able to detect when this change [P3]." 4.3 Discussion and takeaways 4.3.1 The emergence of an iterative task model. The tasks in an IE phase can be repeated across multiple iterations (see Figure</figDesc></figure>

Foraging information can be challenging as mentioned by one participant: "The biggest challenge is generally knowing what information we are interested in extracting [P5]." Following are some of the challenges as users seek information. Perceptual scalability: One participant pointed out how perceiving even small samples of data can be challenging: "It was difcult for us to explore a fraction of the data [P2]." Another participant commented: ". . . There's there's no really good way to verify rules (quality) because the corpus is huge [P4]." Lack of context: Participants also requested features to automatically highlight interesting information as they sought details on demand: ". . . just having indicators that show this is a good example. This is negative and this is not [P3]." While viewing information in context is helpful in understanding the data, features capturing such context are lacking in existing solutions: ". . . show the results and let you explore those results interactively. I think even that is a really useful feature. Currently, for example, I will do that and go to my fles and see what's wrong and change [P3]."</figDesc></figure>

Create Rubric: Using this action users map the defned semantics to actionable rules. For example, in the salient fact extraction project (P1) collaborators identifed two properties of salient facts, which they later used for extraction (MB): "we observed two characteristics. First one is the uncommon attributes, like some attribute that do not belong to all entities. And the second one is the scope, something measurable numerically."</cell><cell>ing to this task are validate and evaluate. The actions related to validation are often informal measurements of user actions. For example, measuring crowdworker quality and annotator agreement for crowdsourcing action (MB). Other examples include assessing model performance during iterative refnement such as error rate and ratio of positive and negative examples per rule (ME). The evaluate action measures the performance of the actions pursued in the model evaluation and deployment phases (ME, MD). Examples include measuring precision and recall/coverage, rank of top-k, mean avg rank, accuracy and F1.</cell></row><row><cell cols="3">5.1.4 Pursue.

Defne semantics: Actions related to defning semantics involve multiple collaborators who often reach consensus via ad hoc discussions: "It's subjective. We will have meetings with others for agreement . . . Do we actually add something or remove something or refne the label [P1]." For example, one participants explained how they designed human intelligence tasks (HITs) for crowdsourcing labeled data (MB): ". . . I will annotate and also, team members employed for data cleaning (DP), issuing crowdsourced labeling tasks or creating new models (MB), reusing existing rules or models (MD).
