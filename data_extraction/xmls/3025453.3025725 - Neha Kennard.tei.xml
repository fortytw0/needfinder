<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Many health care providers, with a variety of trainings, counsel clients on quitting smoking on a day-to-day basis. In their clinical practice, they draw from and adapt guidelines and research-based strategies to fit individual client situations and challenges. Designers of technologies to support quitting smoking can learn from these real world practices to create tools that better adapt to individual differences. We present findings from interviews with 28 providers with diverse experiences in smoking cessation counselling. Through analysis of their individualization strategies, challenges, and perceptions of technology, we find that providers: (1) individualize context appropriate coping strategies by involving clients in brainstorming, (2) emphasize the need to support nicotine withdrawal in clients, (3) mitigate social triggers and mediate social support for clients, and (4) need to navigate dependencies with other providers for managing medications and comorbid health conditions of clients. With this empirical understanding, we extend the discussion on the design of technology to support quitting smoking, highlight current barriers to individualization, and suggest future opportunities to address these barriers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Approximately 40 million people in the United States smoke cigarettes <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">59]</ref>. Smoking is both a behavioral challenge and requires medical support <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[59]</ref>. Needs and challenges of people who want to quit smoking vary at the individual level <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">49]</ref>. Although, some people succeed in quitting cold turkey or in a single attempt, most others relapse multiple times <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">59]</ref>. Individualized external support for treatment and guidance on self-management of smoking behavior from providers, peers, or technology can help individuals cope with challenges in quitting effectively.</p><p>Over 70% of people who smoke are in frequent contact with physicians, nurse practitioners, counselors, therapists, and other clinicians <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[59]</ref>. We henceforth use the term providers to refer to this collection of practitioners. Strategies have been recommended for in-person smoking cessation counseling to tailor to specific needs of individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">59]</ref>. However, primary care physicians and residents are known to face common barriers such as lack of training, time, and resources to support smoking cessation and conflicts in priorities while managing other health conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">39]</ref>. Physicians are thus recommended to redirect clients to dedicated tobacco cessation counsellors and/or telephone based quitline counselors for specialized counseling on quitting smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[39]</ref>.</p><p>Technology has also emerged as an effective medium for the delivery and tailoring of interventions to support quitting smoking, due to its low cost, increasing availability, and computing power, [2, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">58]</ref>. Recent research has involved people who have quit or want to quit smoking in design activities to better understand their individual needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">49]</ref>. Design recommendations from these studies primarily emphasize the need for further individualization based on age, willingness to quit, quitting stage, smoking frequency, and personal goals and preferences such as optional social features <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">49]</ref>. Most current apps do not address these tailoring needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">29]</ref>.</p><p>While previous studies describe client preferences from technology, it is also important to incorporate provider perspectives in design of technology for treatment of nicotine addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">42]</ref>. Providers have a wealth of experiential knowledge in how to individualize counseling for people working to quit smoking. Related work using close-ended surveys with providers convey their perception of the importance of various features in technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr">67]</ref>. Less is known about open-ended perspectives of providers on technology, such as why they consider certain features important, needs not met by technology, and how to design for these needs. An empirical understanding of practices and perceptions of providers on technology can help further efforts to understand needs and challenges of individualizing support for smoking cessation in real world contexts.</p><p>In this study, we took an empirical approach of interviewing 28 providers in the United States with diverse experiences in counseling clients to quit smoking: primary care physicians, mental health care providers, and dedicated tobacco cessation and addiction counselors. In the process of counselling for smoking cessation, providers individualize and adapt to behavioral, medication, and social needs that vary from client to client. In addition, providers face major challenges in managing clients' comorbid health concerns and conflicting priorities of other providers. Our primary contribution is the empirical understanding of provider strategies and perspectives on needs from client-facing technology for smoking cessation. In our discussion, we draw our findings and on prior work's description of client needs to suggest design opportunities and to draw the attention of the HCI community to underexplored challenges in quitting smoking that might be addressed by technology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RELATED WORK</head><p>Tobacco smoking continues to be the leading cause of preventable diseases and death in the United States, and is attributed as cause of over 480,000 deaths a year <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[32]</ref>. In 2014, the annual cost of medical care and loss of productivity due to premature death attributed to smoking-related health consequences was between $289 billion and $333 billion <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[32]</ref>. While smoking is a public health challenge, quitting smoking can be an intensely personal struggle <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[49]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individualized nature of quitting smoking</head><p>Individuals report different triggers for smoking and relapsing, experience different levels of difficulty with nicotine withdrawal, or may use smoking as a coping strategy for comorbid mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">49]</ref>. Comorbid addiction to illicit drugs and alcohol also contribute to relapses or switching to smoking as a drug of choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[54]</ref>. Unemployment, homelessness, lack of insurance, and lack of access to healthcare are some socio-economic barriers individuals face in accessing resources to quit smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[28]</ref>. In their quit attempts, some individuals seek expert or peer support, avoid triggering activities and locations, or engage in activities to distract from thoughts of smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[52]</ref>. Interestingly, these activities might function as successful coping strategies for some but act as triggers for others, which reinforces the need for individualized support for behavioral and medical interventions. We discuss "individualized" support or intervention consistent with Lauver et al.'s definition for patient-centered interventions: "an intervention that is highly customized to a particular individual and that person's situation" <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[37]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evidence-based interventions for quitting smoking</head><p>Quitting cold-turkey is occasionally successful, but not medically advisable. The US Clinical guidelines recommends both behavioral (5As: Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) and pharmacotherapy (7 FDA approved medications) <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[59]</ref> as the best practice for smoking cessation counseling. Theory-driven behavioral interventions for smoking cessation <ref type="bibr">[41]</ref> include Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref>, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">24]</ref>, Contingency Management (CM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[17]</ref>, and Motivational Interviewing (MI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[66]</ref>. The Behavior Change Taxonomy provides a summary of behavior change techniques (BCTs) <ref type="bibr">[44]</ref>. The Behavior Change Wheel <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[45]</ref>, which is also validated against the English Tobacco cessation guidelines, defines nine categories of interventionsmodelling, environmental restructuring, education, persuasion, incentivization, coercion, training, restricting, and enablement. Clinical guidelines for smoking cessation counselling also recommend addressing social triggers, facilitating development of social support, and directing clients to quitline and local support networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[43]</ref>.</p><p>When preparing a quit plan, US clinical guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[59]</ref> recommend that providers tailor behavioral strategies and medications based on the client's demographics, tobacco use, socio-economic costs of smoking, impact of smoking on others, motivation level, reasons clients want to quit, impact on comorbid health symptoms, concerns about quitting, withdrawal symptoms, and success and difficulties in past attempts at quitting. Interventions may be also tailored based on the individual's willingness to change (MI), Experiential Avoidance (ACT), or stages of change in Transtheoretical model <ref type="bibr">[53]</ref>. Tailored interventions are proven to be more effective to support quitting than non-tailored interventions, and technology offers many accessible platforms for tailoring intervention delivery and feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[58]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Designing individualized technology to quit smoking</head><p>Means of delivering technology-based interventions for smoking cessation include telephone conversations, text messaging, web-based applications (such as websites, online communities, social media), and smartphone applications <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">29]</ref>. Types of interventions include educational or motivational messages, communicating with counselors and peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">52]</ref>, networking with social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr">65]</ref>, automated interventions, self-tracking, and game-based or gamified interventions. Over the years, the number of smoking cessation smartphone applications available for free or low cost has increased to 546 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">29]</ref>. Some technologybased applications facilitate tracking cigarettes, monetary, and health benefits, motivational messages, provide a suite of interventions for individuals to choose from, others tailor based on questionnaires on stages of quitting, before assigning interventions <ref type="bibr">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">58]</ref>. However, from a recent content analysis, smartphone applications do not tailor interventions beyond providing trackers, calendars and calculators and rarely follow recommended tailoring guidelines of clinical practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Design studies recommend individualizing support through technology based on user's quitting stage, age, family situation, and socio-economic situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[49]</ref>. Individuals who want to quit also perceived benefits in self-tracking smoking behavior, novelty of information, immediate and meaningful rewards, and achievable coping tips. Clients also differ in preference for social support or consider quitting to be a solo struggle. Some clients also prefer being connected to smoking cessation experts. A study of the QuittyLink app <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">51]</ref> showed potential for higher user engagement and increased motivation to quit when intervention messages were personalized by a quit-smoking helpline counselor who remotely reviewed the data users tracked data their mobile device and provided weekly messages.</p><p>Needs and perspectives of providers, who are also important stakeholders in the treatment of nicotine addiction, are relatively less studied to inform design of technology. Recent independent survey studies in the US <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[42]</ref> and Australia <ref type="bibr">[67]</ref> showed providers have primarily positive attitudes towards potential use of technology for smoking cessation support. Both providers and clients preferred features in applications that allow users to track their progress, personalize, match, and adapt to changing interests and needs of clients, and help manage withdrawal symptoms and medication needs for nicotine addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">42]</ref>. However, majority of providers did not consider current apps to be effective for smoking cessation <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[42]</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study procedures</head><p>We conducted one-on-one semi-structured interviews with each participant to understand current individualization strategies and challenges in smoking cessation counseling. The average length of our interviews was 52 minutes (range: 30-84 min). Topics included (1) how participants began the process of counseling someone who wants to quit smoking, (2) modifications they make in their counseling strategies from one client to another, (3) relapse handling, (4) follow up strategies, (5) incorporating informal social support into counseling (friends, family, peers), ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>) challenges they face in counseling, (7) current use of tools and technology to assist in counseling, and (8) perceptions of client use of tools and technology for smoking cessation.</p><p>We showed participants low-fidelity design sketches (storyboards and wireframes) of a wizard based design of a self-management mobile app illustrating prompts to guide clients to individualize interventions based on their reason to quit, concerns with quitting, interests, example interventions (e.g., mindfulness, yoga), and ways to log and visualize behavior related to smoking (auxiliary materials, Appendix B). These sketches helped elicit responses from the providers on their perceived needs for clients and technology to support quitting smoking. Twenty seven interviews were conducted over phone and one interview was conducted inperson. For phone interviews, we emailed a PDF of our design sketches to each participant. All interviews were audio-recorded with consent and transcribed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>First, the first author (AB) randomly selected five interview transcripts and coded them inductively <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[56]</ref>. Next, she conducted affinity diagramming to develop higher level clusters and categories of the codes using both inductive and deductive approach informed by our research questions <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[30]</ref>. AB, the second author (RV) (who read 4 transcripts), and an independent researcher not familiar with the data, were involved in discussions and refinement of affinity clusters. AB used this set of codes to analyze the remaining transcripts while constantly comparing among interviews to understand patterns of similarities and differences across participant perspectives. AB wrote memos on codes and data and shared them with all authors after completing analysis of all interviews. To ensure validity, discussions on findings were conducted with the research team at all stages. We describe our findings that contribute to an in-depth understanding of provider perspectives to inform design of applications for quitting smoking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINDINGS</head><p>All participants recognized the diverse needs of their clients while quitting smoking and emphasized providing unique and individualized support for each client. While a majority of the participants said they set quit dates with their clients, they added that only a few of their clients succeeded in quitting "cold turkey", i.e. attempting to quit all their cigarettes simultaneously on a set quit date. Majority of their clients required individualized support to reduce smoking over a longer term with multiple setbacks. P10 describes the variation as, "This [counseling approach] is actually very individualized. Some people find it easier to cut down slowly, but other people feel like if they do that then they will never quit. I have a lot of patients-probably more patients, that cut down slowly than they do quit cold <ref type="bibr">[turkey]</ref>."</p><p>Four primary themes in which individualization is key emerged from our analysis: (1) providers brainstorm context appropriate behavioral strategies with clients, (2) providers emphasize support for nicotine withdrawal, (3) providers need to mediate social support for clients, and (4) providers need to navigate dependencies with other providers. Across each theme, we summarize tailoring strategies providers use that are consistent with literature and then expand on perceptions of providers on how they further individualize from what is recommended, barriers they face, tools they use, and their insights on our design prototypes. We then summarize the perceptions of providers and their use of technology based applications for quitting smoking and their perceived barriers to adoption of smartphone applications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Providers involve clients in brainstorming contextappropriate strategies</head><p>For behavioral counseling, strategies mentioned by providers can be roughly summarized by the intervention categories defined by Michie et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[45]</ref>. Providers mentioned using specific sets of strategies for behavioral support based on their expertise or training: CBT (5), MI (8), ACT (1), 5 Ds [5] -Delay, Distract yourself, Deep breathing, Drink water, Discuss your feelings -( <ref type="formula">4</ref>), and clinical guidelines (5As) <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[59]</ref>. Providers said they primarily take on the role of educators and facilitators, emphasize informing clients about options available for support, and support client autonomy.</p><p>No participant reported using coercion or scare tactics if clients were not ready to quit.</p><p>In addition to asking clients initial assessment questions such as their smoking behavior and health condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[59]</ref>, all providers emphasized assessing the context that each client associated with smoking before setting a quit plan and also after relapses. This assessment helped providers to recommend example strategies to break the association of specific contexts with client's smoking behavior, such as by restructuring the environment. Context was explained by providers as the time of the day, environmental cues, social factors, and the activity that a client engaged in before, during, and after smoking. Providers said they ask clients if they had already identified challenges or factors that triggered their craving in specific contexts, such as if their most difficult cigarette to quit is the morning cigarette or the one at work. C02 also explained context in terms of time of the year and events significant to the client: "In my experience, people need that one year of birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, season changes et cetera, where they get support around staying tobacco free or nicotine free."</p><p>Recommending intervention strategies after assessing context was a collaborative process between the client and the provider. Providers described this as a process of "brainstorming." To facilitate brainstorming, providers suggested examples from evidence based practices or by modelling, and provided prompts for clients to think about strategies or to come up with their own ideas based on their interests, abilities, likes, and dislikes. As a result of this process, the strategies were highly individualized to fit into the context of the client's daily life and to give clients concrete and actionable strategies to work with. For example; C21 explained, "Our strategy is to include the patient in brainstorming or developing coping skills to manage some of their biggest challenges, rather than giving them more of a cookie cutter or scripted strategy to help them As tools to assess client smoking behavior and context, most providers rely on verbal recall from clients, but some encourage clients to use paper-based tools between sessions to note these factors such as worksheets, journaling, or index cards with header cues (e.g., "note your most difficult cigarette to quit" (M01)). Few providers mentioned maintaining paper based records for themselves, which they referred to during follow-ups. Physicians (N=5) and quitline counselors (N=2) had access to their internal online system for note taking. Quitline counselors share a database linked to the unique id of the caller. However, for some providers, especially in inpatient units (N=11), follow up was not possible to iterate on or determine effectiveness of strategies.</p><p>In our design prototype, we anticipated that the user could follow a specific intervention each day (Appendix B, page 16 to 11 </p><p>). They suggested it let them enter their own "specific personal goals" based on interests and benefits that clients perceived from quitting, such as quitting for a surgery or "be a transplant candidate" (C03).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Providers emphasize support for nicotine withdrawal</head><p>As per guidelines, medications need to be tailored based on the number of cigarettes, prior successful use of medication, tolerance or ease-of-use, out-of-pocket patient cost, likelihood of adherence, dentures (chewing gum), dermatitis (patch), and comorbid conditions like depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[59]</ref>. Even after working with clients on side-effects, preference, and cost of medication, providers mentioned that adherence to right dosage for smoking cessation medications was a major challenge. Specifically, two providers (C02 and C20) said that they have had clients who were not able to taper off of nicotine replacement products as recommended and continued to stay addicted to nicotine in over the counter products for longer periods of time (over 5 years in case of C02's client). According to providers, medication usage required guidance for self-management on clients' side.</p><p>In our design prototypes, we did not provide any option to track medications. Some providers highlighted that technology should support the client in managing their medication. For example, C02 explained the need to incorporate support for information and self-management of medication dosage in our design prototype, "I'd put something in there [design probe]…about exploring the idea of using medication-and they may or may not want to use products. But if they are using [nicotine replacement] products, that will need support and benefits for they will usually use them wrong. <ref type="bibr">And [clinic_name]</ref> has studied this and they say that most people, when they are using an over the counter nicotine product, they under dose and they don't dose long enough." Some providers, especially those who had experience quitting smoking themselves (N=9), brought to our attention that outcomes for behavioral tracking features shown in our design sketches -such as mood, alertness, cravings, and appetite (Appendix B, page 19)-will vary dynamically due to variations in withdrawal from nicotine and how clients supplement it with pharmacotherapy. For example, C25 who quit smoking herself, explained, "Depending on how they're quitting it, if they're not using any pharmacotherapy, they could have some of these things be really high and then work down to low. If they're using good pharmacotherapy, these may stay low, but that would also reinforce that, "Hey, the pharmacotherapy is working for me. I'm not having to deal with withdrawal symptoms!" Providers emphasized the need for appropriate feedback, and guidance to clients to be selfaware, not feel discouraged, and understand trends in their outcomes, especially, in their initial days of quitting. They also suggested that type of behavioral intervention, timing and frequency of reminders and logging prompts be individualized to the dynamic needs of nicotine craving to not remind clients about smoking when they are not craving: depending on the number of cigarettes clients smoke and their medication intake.</p><p>Thus, providers emphasized that tools individualize educational interventions for different information needs of a client about medications, encourage adequate dosage, and enable dynamic tracking and feedback based on individual differences in clients' behavioral and physiological responses to withdrawal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Providers mediate social support for clients</head><p>As all clients did not have similar social situations, providers needed to individualize treatment by mediating offline social factors for clients both in terms of negative social triggers and positive social support. Providers perceived that a key barrier to quitting for clients is having a family member or someone with whom they live who also smokes. According to providers, these people prompt clients to smoke and often also contribute to misinformation about smoking, which can make the clients less receptive to treatment and counseling. Some providers believe that even negative pressure from family members who did not smoke can make some clients resistant to counseling, such as nagging the client and/or inflicting emotions of hurt, anger, guilt, or blaming the client for exposure to passive smoking.</p><p>To manage social triggers, providers advise clients to not smoke with friends and family who smoke. However, they encourage clients to maintain relations with them outside of smoking activities, as providers also did not want the client to feel socially isolated. All providers emphasized the need and benefits of having social support for quitting smoking from family, friends, a buddy, and/or peers. Their strategies include educating the client and the family together, encourage friends and family members to quit together, and some even arrange for cost-free support for the client and the person who lives with them. C13 explained, "In fact, our program that we offer for free-for our orientations, I told my boss, 'We need to offer that for anybody living in the household.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I don't care if it's a roommate or if it's a family member. If they live with the patient, they can come for free to our program.'"</head><p>For clients who do not have support from close social ties, providers help them identify people in their extended social circle could be their "buddy" -someone they could talk to or call when they have a craving, and can remind them to not smoke. Providers encourage clients to reach out to this person through different means, for example; someone at work, local recreational communities such as the YMCA, or local peer support groups. Interestingly, many providers explained that even people who smoke and do not want to quit with the client could be of support or be a buddy, provided they "promise" to not smoke in presence of the client and not cue the client to smoke.</p><p>Few providers said they hand paper-based resources to clients and their social circle on how to ask someone for support (e.g., worksheets, writing letters in workshop) or how to support someone on quitting smoking, respectively. Providers urged clients to call the quitline as a form of expert social support during cravings. For example, M05 explained, "The reason that [quitline] is probably real good is because the impulse or the urge to use after quitting can last just a few minutes. And so a phone call could make the difference." Participants perceived that calling, texting, or sharing and connecting with peers online for social support is an effective strategy to counter real time cravings. For example; C28 shared her client's narrative of getting instantaneous conversational support on an online post on their craving: "One of my clients said to me, 'I had a craving, I went to the app and I put on the app…' I think it was some Facebook app. And he said, 'I am having a craving right now' and right away somebody answers the app and helped him ...you know, support system. 'Don't do it, why do you want to smoke right now?' and they went back and forth on a little chat and then that helped him not to have that one cigarette." Providers also envisioned that technology could benefit clients by locating and connecting them with offline social support, such as local support groups, and by encouraging clients with appropriate prompts to proactively identify "buddies" in their social circle similar to their counselling process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Providers need to navigate dependencies</head><p>Preferences for medication and struggles with comorbid health conditions vary from one client to another and these are major factors in individualizing smoking cessation counseling. However, a single provider is not equipped with resources to cater to all these needs. Therefore, providers have to individualize treatment for nicotine addiction not only based on client needs but also depending on their own care context, training, resources they have available, and client access to other providers. We found that providers need to redirect clients to other providers for three main activities: (1) specialized counseling and follow up for smoking cessation, (2) prescribing smoking cessation medications, and (3) adjusting treatment for smoking alongside comorbid health conditions. Unresolved conflicts surfaced in this redirection process.</p><p>Physicians (N=4) have the ability to prescribe medications, but consistent with prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">39]</ref>, they are constrained for time. Physicians direct clients to nurses or support staff with tobacco cessation training and/or quitline who are able to dedicate time and are skilled in counseling on quitting smoking. However, nurses and dedicated cessation counselors (N=19) explained that they cannot prescribe medications and need to redirect clients to consult a primary care physician if the client prefers prescription drugs, such as Chantix or Wellbutrin. It was a common perception among providers that each state's quitline gives out nicotine replacement products free of cost, and so they recommend call the quitline. Quitline counselors, however, reported that the availability of free nicotine replacement products timely (e.g., once a (C17)), depends on their funding program, and eligibility of the client depending on a medical assessment and insurance coverage. C28, a quitline counselor, summarized: "Sometimes we have programs in which they <ref type="bibr">[clients]</ref> could get free patches, but they will still have to go through protocol before they can get the patches…Some insurance would rather pay for the Chantix of the patches... We never really give Chantix that has to be prescribed by their physician." Thus, quitline counselors also need to relay the client back to their physician for prescribed medications.</p><p>While working with clients who have comorbid physical and/or mental illnesses, providers prioritized treatment for smoking differently. For physical illnesses (cancer, respiratory and heart diseases), providers said they prioritize and catalyze client motivation to first quit smoking them how their smoking habits aggravate symptoms. Even though, quitting smoking improves people's mental health, due to in receptiveness abilities of clients with mental illness, 4 out of 5 mental providers and all others perceived the need to stabilize mental health symptoms before proceeding with a client for smoking. They acknowledged that clients used smoking as a coping strategy for mental health and struggled to educate clients on of impact of smoking on mental health. P10, primary care physician, explained, lot of them are not listening to you when you're talking to them about health consequences of smoking. So if you're trying to help them stop smoking-if they are very depressed-it's just not gonna work. So you really have to treat the depression before you can focus on the cigarettes." who do not have assessment tools for mental health, relevant background, or appointments with mental facilities, relied on their subjective discernment of of mental health symptoms. These providers said redirect clients to consult with their primary care physician or mental health care to get a diagnosis readjust treatment. For clients with unstable symptoms, emphasized the need to be careful with possible of medication supplements for nicotine (such as irritability, insomnia, and even possible concerns of suicidal and homicidal ideations for drugs such Chantix <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">63]</ref>), and monitor clients closely. C14 her concerns in recommending Chantix to her clients with depression due to perceived concerns of suicidal and/or homicidal ideations.</p><p>priorities differed in treating clients with comorbid in two ways: (1) treating clients for quitting smoking together with other drugs and alcohol and (2) treating clients for quitting other drugs first, and then treat them for quitting smoking. Providers who assigned equal priority to quitting smoking perceived alcohol as a common trigger and said that clients need support to quit alcohol drugs that impair senses and self-control, at the same as quitting smoking. C14 explained, "What's going to happen is you will have quit, maybe it's for a few days, a few weeks, a few months, and you go out drinking, and you look the next thing you know, you've got a half a pack of and you smoked half a pack… clouded your to make that decision about what you really wanted." expressed discontent with lack of support for quitting while quitting other substances. The second group participants considered quitting smoking to be of lower than quitting other substances they perceived to be harmful (harm reduction model <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[54]</ref>) or encouraged choice in which substance they wanted to quit first. For example, C26 described: "We had somebody recently who came in and smoking was very low priority because she was very heavily and was wanting to quit drinking, and psychiatrist wanted her to actually check into an facility before we would even treat her [for smoking]." is evidence that quitting smoking at the time does not negatively impact drug abuse outcomes on-going efforts are integrating of substance abuse with smoking cessation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[36]</ref>.</p><p>Due to these differences in expertise and priorities, the need to re-direct clients to other providers for medication or comorbidities hinder treatment for nicotine Current technological solutions do not support for either providers or clients to manage comorbidities while quitting smoking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PERCEPTIONS ON USE OF TECHNOLOGY</head><p>Consistent with related work <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr">67]</ref>, providers perceived to have many benefits to support quitting Table <ref type="table">2</ref> summarizes current technology-based tools that participants recommend their clients, and their functions. Providers primarily use technology to information, follow up with clients over email, phone, text messages, and/or to broadcast information to clients over longer term on mailing lists. Participants expressed the to understand the application's source, cost, agenda, they are based on evidence based practices, and preferred recommending federal or state affiliated sources websites. For example, M04 said, do worry, when tells me they found a new app, I worry initially like created it, where they get their funding? Kinda what's motivation? I like it when they're created by reputable sources…I really worry-is there any hidden agenda or is science sound." They also reported that clients perceive from features on smartphone apps such as tracking viewing "cigarette free time", number of cigarettes, health benefits, and money saved. Providers that some people are more likely to prefer technology for support over provider visits due to reasons as perceived stigma, not wanting to appear vulnerable or seek help, and personal choice and privacy.  Access information on quitting smoking resources and coping strategies  Refer to interactive online tools to help clients create plan (Ex Plan)</p><p>Refer to mobile apps that clients could download  Providers answer questions on forums (Quora)  Clients maintain records of their smoking behavior (Google docs)  Clients look up medications and side-effects before asking providers  Clients connect with peers online to get support and share experiences</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 2: Functions of technology-based tools recommended by providers or perceived used by their clients</head><p>C16 explains: think the challenge with the younger people-at least in my experience, has been they don't think need help. Whereas if they've got an app on their phone, they may have more tendency to use it because no one else know they're using it...I've done cessation groups at bases. Often times, they don't want to appear weak." The younger population makes up the majority of users of apps for quitting smoking (median age 31 years, 18-67 years) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and quitline services (mean age 39.4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[25]</ref>. Stigma is also a major barrier to accessing inperson health care treatment for those with concerns of addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[40]</ref> and mental health challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>. asked who would not benefit from technology, attributed client preferences for in-person social support as a potential reason for non-use of technology. For C02 who was a peer support group facilitator, perceived that "people who turn to coming to the support aren't real mobile app kinda people." She reported she also regularly communicated with her clients between sessions on smoking related concerns via phone text messages, and emails, but she preferred to initiate contact and for follow-ups or checking with clients, after connection was established. P06 that lack of self-motivation in his clients was a key reason his clients seek provider help over use of mobile applications to quit smoking: "The problem most of patients have is internal motivation-self-drive. And to have a phone saying, ok now go do your yoga when they are on the street or-cigarettes are one of the least of addictions-it really relies on patient's internal self-Many of my patients, if they have that [selfmotivation], they wouldn't be in my clinic."</p><p>While giving feedback on our design prototypes, providers also explained that while most clients have smart phones, of their clients either did not own smartphones or will be able to use smartphone applications for quitting</p><p>The specific population groups that providers include older population (55 years and above), population, low income groups, people facing people with learning disabilities and of comorbid health conditions that prevent them using smartphones, and people with comorbid Few providers observed that clients mainly use their smartphones for calling features and had difficulty apps or text messaging features. For example, C21 a range of difficulties that could act as barriers to using smartphones for her clients, "The population I serve, really has challenges with technology. Sometimes, especially they have a mental health challenge or a learning or if they're a little bit older… [or] don't have as resources or don't have as many learning experiences. applications and more advanced technologiesnot all the time-is outside of the scope of their abilities." explained this with the caveat that there are exceptions to individuals in these population groups who smartphones and will be able to use them. Though the rate of use of technology for health care needs is low in older <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[38]</ref> and population with challenges of mental health and homelessness <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[33]</ref>, it is increasing.</p><p>To summarize, providers work to individualize smoking treatment to specific contexts that clients associate with smoking behavior, differences in client access to and usage of medications for withdrawal symptoms, different situations that act as trigger or support for clients, and differences in treatment of their comorbid health conditions. We discuss opportunities on how to integrate lessons learned from these findings needs identified from prior work to better adapt the design of technology for quitting smoking. Our prototypes were specific to smartphone applications, but we believe these opportunities are applicable across various platforms tools that providers and clients are comfortable using.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contextualizing Interventions</head><p>We three steps for to support that adapt to an individual's (1) help users to record and visualize situation (similar to in context), time, and location of smoking has to increase client's self-awareness about their smoking behavior and motivation to quit <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">51]</ref>. This design be extended to allow logging and integration with other of context during smoking: people, environmental and special events. Allowing users to label the contexts as, in which it is most difficult to quit) could facilitate the context to tackle, first. The Ubicomp continues advance automated sensing technology [55], and we urge for this to continue to be a priority as it can facilitate tracking contexts than user-initiated logging, may be difficult and/or socially stigmatizing . Systems may also not need to achieve very high accuracy: they could potential record smoking or craving contexts in the moment.</p><p>at an opportune moment, they could ask users to verify and, if an actual craving, to rate its difficulty. Reviewing captured data plus any data later entered by the user could also support the process of planning interventions to try the time they are in a similar context.</p><p>Just in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAI) aim to detect triggering contexts and "push" micro-randomized to clients <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[35]</ref>. Clients, however, prefer "pull" over "push" messages due to the perception that poorly timed interventions run the risk of reminding them about smoking they tend to dismiss them <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[27]</ref>. Clients also prefer that are of interest to them, tips that are achievable and relatable to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[48]</ref>, and rewards that are to them. Given the rapidly changing and behavioral needs while quitting smoking, is a need that technology should leverage the of clients about their varying context and enable with skills to respond effectively in vulnerable such as during cravings.</p><p>We found that providers currently individualize to these needs by guiding client input in brainstorming through and examples. To design for a similar process, coping strategies could be grouped into clusters of pertinent tagged by crowdsourcing, expert, or peer feedback to how many card sorting programs work. Clients and can then work together to make matched suggestions to contexts that trigger smoking in clients. When combined with user feedback or tracked behavior, the clusters can be further matched to an individual's context using machine learning techniques <ref type="bibr">[55]</ref> or after a self-experimentation process <ref type="bibr">[34]</ref>. Clients can then modify, and save lists of strategies per context and them, or the system can remind them of these when similar contexts are detected.</p><p>way to facilitate such brainstorming might be to the development of decision rules for which interventions clients will use in which situations. This could take the form of supporting end user programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[60]</ref>, as in If This Then That (IFTTT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[68]</ref> and in some other contexts of health <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">23]</ref>. For example, client can be shown a list of their triggering contexts and a list of coping which they can match; software could then then help them implement these rules. Opportunities for such initiated planning could be before anticipated trigger reflecting after lapsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[52]</ref>.</p><p>It may also be possible to combine this approach with selfexperimentation [34], to guide the end-user to generate and hypotheses on effectiveness of an intervention in a particular context. This has the potential to improve client firsthand about the effectiveness of different coping strategies. Designs that help clients internalize this may reduce their dependence on the system for support and help them make decisions next time they face a similar context.</p><p>There are many possible approaches to gathering client input potential interventions, and it is important that research continue to develop them and designers implement them. Gathering client input is an important element of both current provider practices and the Decision Making (SDM) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[20]</ref> in patient-centered care which encourages clinicians to inform clients, provide them with choices, and help clients make their own decisions in treatment. While a process can increase the cognitive load on the client, has been shown to be an effective model to help patient engagement and outcomes in clinical care Design research should explore the feasibility and of facilitating client input in deciding interventions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Opportunities to mitigate barriers to individualization</head><p>some barriers to individualization-such as conflicting treatment priorities and medication access-will require public health reforms and policy changes. We hope awareness of these barriers can help designers consider the limitations of technological solutions, and help them identify niches to which they can contribute. Some crucial opportunities technology to reduce barriers to individualizing care include: catalyzing social support, supporting withdrawal and inclusion of individuals who are at high and/or facing comorbidities, to also benefit from technology for quitting smoking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Catalyzing social support</head><p>Providers highlight the difficulty a client faces in when their offline social circle is not supportive. Education programs for a client's social circle not feasible in every clinical setting due to cost, time, willingness to engage. An of future research might be to design closed networking for a selected group of people offline Both providers and clients consider features to support management medications important <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">42]</ref>, but commercial apps for smoking cessation do not support <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">29]</ref>. For prescribed medications, close monitoring and dosage adherence can be encouraged through networked apps between provider and client, where the enters dosage information and client logs intake <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[19]</ref>. Technology should encourage the to seek assistance on medication support from experts in situations such as undesirable side-effects and emergency (such as a phone call button) when a facing crisis To facilitate information needs and autonomy, cessation applications should integrate medication (e.g., instructions on adequate dosage and sideeffects when clients or providers enter names of over-thecounter products) and tracking functionalities such as those the app Drugs.com <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[69]</ref>.</p><p>Clients need apps to adapt to their changing needs during nicotine withdrawal <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[27]</ref>. Insights from providers help us envision a system that can model and predict withdrawal client logs of smoking intensity and medication intake. example; in the initial days of quitting, if the client's physiological measures (e.g., mood, alertness) degrade due to withdrawal, the client's motivation may benefit if shown examples-either system generated or from a peer-for how response patterns are expected to vary during Such feedback can help the client normalize and manage their expectations during quitting. Predicting and projecting expected improvements in behavioral outcomes in far future can encourage to continue logging and not smoke. Also, crisis situations can detected and averted by setting -such as, if mood persistently drop below a threshold level indicating increase of depressive symptoms, the client can be alerted to their buddy or care team.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comorbidities in high-risk population</head><p>In addition to supporting or recommending different treatment options for a specific health challenge, there is also need for tools that can help people better prioritize and coordinate treatment for comorbid health conditions. For example; data-soloing may lead to people receiving conflicting advice from different health applications they use to work on different health goals. Similarly, if someone uses different applications to address comorbid challenges, such depression, and smoking, each application might ask them to and track mood, user burden unnecessarily. For those who struggle comorbid substance addiction, tools should also contextualizing interventions based on specific and patterns of cravings for substance use. support quitting needs for people who have comorbid challenges and socio-economic challenges, for whom rates are also prevalent <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[32]</ref>, designers should how low cost support can be facilitated-for designing for compatibility with low cost devices, minimizing or avoiding cost data access, and utilizing resources such as systems in community based <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[18]</ref>. Designers should also incorporate diverse and accessibility needs for aging population and for those with psychiatric symptoms and cognitive and motor <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr">64]</ref>. While applications that are universally and support integrated features to manage comorbidities and are ideal, feasibility of how to design such by optimizing user-burden needs to be explored.</p><p>In this study, we examined everyday counseling practices challenges of providers, and incorporated their insights inform design of technology that can better assist the process of quitting smoking. Future research should explore client perspectives on context-appropriate the feasibility of technology to facilitate client input for planning context appropriate interventions, and to support interactions. We suggest several promising research and design opportunities, such as positive social support, supporting medication to temper nicotine withdrawal, and including of high risk population in design of quitting tools. effective and individualized tools for smoking can potentially enable more individuals to quit ultimately reducing risks of serious diseases, while their health and quality of life.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Enabling Healthy Behaviors CHI 2017, May 6-11, 2017, Denver, CO, USA</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc><table /></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_3"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Participants particularly liked intervention designs that let the clients create and save their own list of activities to do during quitting (Appendix B, page</figDesc><table /><note>). Providers however highlighted the need to design a tool that can help clients understand different contexts of smoking within the day and then list strategies for that context. For example, M01 conceptualized, "[Prompt clients to] 'make a comprehensive list of all the different contexts and all the different situations you're smoking'. Example, in a car, after a meal-because certain coping mechanisms might be more useful in certain contexts than others. So, could be that in a car it's really easy to listen to very loud music but at work, going out on a break, that's really hard[…]  You might also wanna have that when the app takes a log of the context that you're smoking-which means you might wanna tie the app notifications to the pertinent event."To facilitate brainstorming like process, providers envisioned an app that would prompt suggestions based on what was feasible and actionable for clients, and guided them through complex tasks such as yoga. For example, C11 suggested that the tool should prompt, "'What can you do if you have an urge to smoke? -some people wanna call the crisis line, some people wanna call a friend, go outside, open a window, eat a vegetable, you know that kind of thingchew on some gum.' Things that they do already, things they can afford, things they like to do."</note></figure>

A common concern expressed by providers was that some clients have misinformation and are fearful of medication side-effects leading to issues of non-adherence and inadequate dosage, which increased clients' struggles with withdrawal symptoms. To alleviate such fears and misconceptions, providers said they first need to educate clients about the physiological components of nicotine addiction and emphasize that addiction is not merely a behavioral or moral issue.
