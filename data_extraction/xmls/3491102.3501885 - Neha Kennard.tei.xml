<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Visual efects and elements in video games and interactive virtual environments can be applied to transfer (or delegate) non-visual perceptions (e.g., proprioception, presence, pain) to players and users, thus increasing perceptual diversity via the visual modality. Such elements or efects are referred to as visual delegates (VDs). Current fndings on the experiences that VDs can elicit relate to specifc VDs, not to VDs in general. Deductive and comprehensive VD evaluation frameworks are lacking. We analyzed VDs in video games to generalize VDs in terms of their visual properties. We conducted a systematic paper analysis to explore player and user experiences observed in association with specifc VDs in user studies. We conducted semi-structured interviews with expert players to determine their preferences and the impact of VD properties. The resulting VD framework (VD-frame) contributes to a more strategic approach to identifying the impact of VDs on player and user experiences.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The application of visual efects and visual elements in interactive virtual environments and video games ofer information transfer between the virtual world and the virtual character to users and players. Besides this information transfer, some of these visual effects and elements can also convey complex perceptions, such as pain, speed, or smell, that are usually not conveyed visually in the physical world, but via non-visual sensory modalities, i.e., nociception, proprioception, olfaction, respectively. Since addressing non-visual sensory modalities is difcult in virtual environments with common output devices, e.g., displays, controllers, or headphones, the generation of perceptions of these sensory modalities is delegated to the visual sense, using appropriate visual efects and elements which are referred to as visual delegates (VDs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[86]</ref> . Thus, VDs can be understood as visual efects, elements, or methodologies that can convey perceptions in addition to conveying regular information. Whether perceptual delegation is triggered by corresponding visual efects can depend on many factors, such as visual representation, embedding in the virtual environment, as well as the willingness of recipients to become deeply involved in the narrative and to engage in the delegation of perception. With VDs, other measurable experiences are also induced in users and players, e.g., joy, frustration, or immersion, which create an extensive overall experience.</p><p>To better design tailored perceptual user experiences in interactive virtual environments and specifcally in video games, comprehensive understanding of VDs and its impact on users and players is crucial. However, the properties of VDs and their infuence on user experience have not yet been sufciently explored scientifcally. Most insights gained from user studies refer to specifc VDs with specifc use cases or to "regular" visual game elements without refecting their ability of perception delegation. Yet, many other VDs are unexplored, which makes it much more difcult to make more general assessments about the impact of VDs on users and players. Furthermore, conducting user surveys for evaluating VDs are often extensive, which can be difcult, especially for indie developers, inexperienced designers, and industries with fast evaluation cycles, e.g., developing interactive virtual environments or (serious) games, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">108]</ref>. As a result, the potential to purposefully enhance visual elements and efects into VDs to increase perceptual variety is often neglected.</p><p>To address this problem, we developed a framework for analyzing VDs in three steps, which we call VD-frame. In the frst step, we analyzed VDs in video games to identify the visual characteristics of VDs that contribute to perceptual delegation. This resulted in a framework that classifes VDs into three categories and eleven properties. In the second step, we wanted to fnd out whether the VD properties we identifed contribute to enhancing the player and user experience (PUX). Therefore, we conducted a paper analysis to list previously used VDs and to identify which VDs elicit which PUXs in interactive virtual applications and video games. We translated each of the investigated VDs into our VD-frame and determined whether our VD-frame with the categories and properties we established described the investigated VDs accurately or whether our VD-frame had to be extended, if necessary. Thus, our VD-frame was implicitly evaluated during the second step. Since the fndings from the paper analysis were not sufcient in some aspects, we conducted interviews with expert players in a third step to gain more precise insights regarding the impact of VDs on PUXs.</p><p>We oriented towards the VD analysis of Misztal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[86]</ref> who categorized perceptions that are addressed through VDs in interactive 3D video games. With our VD-frame, we extend the work of Misztal et al. and we make the following additional contributions:</p><p>• we provide a framework that allows to determine VDs generally, i.e., defning VDs in terms of their visual properties, which are relevant for perceptual delegation, • we provide insights about players' VD preferences, associated VD properties, and the impact of VDs on PUXs as a basis for fast deductive VD evaluations.</p><p>Our work contributes to better describe and classify VDs and to identify the impact of VDs on PUXs to better understand users and players of interactive virtual environments and video games. We address practitioners who want to improve their VD designs in order to elicit more specifcally desired PUXs. We address theorists who want to participate in further developing the understanding of VDs to establish VDs as controllable interactive mechanics for enhancing PUXs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>In this section, we examine work that helps to better understand application and design decisions of visual efects and elements in video games. We draw conclusions for our VD-frame development.</p><p>Visual elements and their ability to convey status information is one crucial focus of game user interface analysis. Treanor et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[113]</ref> argue that the way elements are visually presented in interactive virtual environments and video games signifcantly infuences the meaning and afordance of these elements. Zammitto <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[124]</ref> investigated visualization techniques in video games focusing on elements that provide useful information to the player. At the time of analysis, the author found that several visual elements in games contained minor and easily fxable design faws. One possible reason is that design decisions are often made intuitively and from experience, but less on the basis of scientifc knowledge. Hicks et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> evaluated visual embellishments, i.e., VDs that "support information already conveyed by other means", and found out that embellishments are generally capable of enhancing player perception. However, the authors emphasized that the design of corresponding embellishments should be applied with care in order to interpret these efects and their infuence more validly. We see the possibility of enhancing player experience through the use of appropriate VDs as a great opportunity and the great potential of VDs in general. Yet, scientifc fndings refer almost exclusively to pure information transfer capabilities of game user interface elements and not to their ability to delegate perceptions. We conclude that there is still need to intensify research in this area to better fnd out how VDs positively infuence player perceptions and player experiences.</p><p>Bowman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> developed a design space for general visualization techniques in video games which consists of fve categories game visualizations can be described with, i.e., primary purpose, target audience, temporal usage, visual complexity, and immersion/integration. The design space of Bowman et al. is suited to describe visualization concepts, such as the head-up display or a replay theater. For use in describing concrete visual efects that delegate perceptions, their design space provides too unspecifc information on visual perception. The authors consider their design space as "casual information visualization" which should not be confused with visualization of game data, that serves the purpose to condense game data into an abstract visual format to allow game user researcher and analysts to better interpret game data, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">115,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">116]</ref>. Fangerholt and Lorentzon <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> formulated guidelines for integrating game elements into user interface design on the basis of their investigations of frst-person shooter games. The authors suggested to consider design spaces as a set of tools and to foster the link between player and virtual character through game user interface design. We agree with this assessment and decided to emphasize the bond between game world, virtual character, and player when creating our VD-frame.</p><p>McLaughlin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[82]</ref> created a taxonomy of computer graphics imagery techniques in serious games and categorized visual elements in games into simplifed, styled, and realistic. Each of the three categories is described by form, motion, and surface/light to distinguish each elemental category in terms of its visual complexity. Their taxonomy also takes into account the technical implementation, i.e., computer graphics algorithms, which, however, strongly depends on the current state of research. For another type of visual elements, such as digital creatures and character, McLaughlin <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[81]</ref> used the semantically same type of classifcation but with diferent class terms, namely primitive, abstract, and naturalistic instead of simplifed, styled, and realistic, respectively. They justifed the change of terminology by an unintentional room for interpretation, caused by the application of the existing class terminology to other types of visual elements. The authors also acknowledged that their categorizations do not always allow an unambiguous classifcation and that exceptions may occur that cannot be clearly classifed. We conclude that diferent visual elements to be analyzed seem to require independent terminology and classifcation, and that classifcation schemes should leave enough room for individual working methods which we intended to consider when developing our VD-frame.</p><p>Babu <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> investigated diferences between diegetic and nondiegetic game interfaces by measuring diferences in gaze fxation time through eye-tracking. As a result, participants spend a lot of time observing the virtual environment. The author interprets that the attempt on the part of the player to understand the virtual environment takes a lot of time and that appropriate status information might facilitate to faster understand the virtual environment. We conclude that the comprehensibility and possibly also the associated facilitation to interpret game elements and information transferred via the virtual world can strongly infuence the duration and thus the game play. Therefore, the aspect of comprehensibility and learning facilitation is taken into account in our analyses.</p><p>Iacovides et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref> investigated diegetic and non-diegetic game elements with expert players and novice players in a frst-person shooter game. The authors showed that non-diegetic game elements can increase cognitive involvement and sense of control by expert players compared to diegetic game elements. Fragoso <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref> conducted a comparable study whose results indicate that too many interface elements integrated into the game world can be perceived as disruptive without negatively infuencing usability or efciency. Besides the concept of diegesis, Fragoso articulated a design space for game element positioning which consists of a material interface, i.e., objects in the game world, an external interface, i.e., elements independent of the game world, and a semiotic interface, i.e., middle ground between game world and head-up display. Schild et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[103]</ref> also created a design space that integrated the concept of diegesis and spatial positioning of game elements. We acknowledge that diegesis and spatial positioning play a signifcant role in the interpretation of game elements. We also see parallels between both concepts and decided to combine and integrate spatial positioning and diegesis into our VD-frame while orienting towards the design spaces of Fragoso and Schild et al.</p><p>Milam et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[85]</ref> diferentiated visual game elements which are in motion with regard to their speed, size, and density. The authors found that design manipulations in speed, size, or density can have an efect on the players' abilities in targeting and diferentiating these visual elements, as well as ignoring distractions. We conclude that the mutability of visual elements plays a crucial part in infuencing the player experience, which is why we decided to integrate the aspect of mutability into our VD-frame.</p><p>The relevance of new and faster approaches for the evaluation of game content results from constantly increasing requirements in game development. <ref type="bibr">Koleva et al. [63]</ref> investigated issues and challenges in game development processes including the design process. One major outcome is that game developers and designers feel a huge pressure to conduct tests on a continual basis. Stahlke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[108]</ref> created a tool to test for player navigation by simulating players with agents without the need to conduct labor-intensive player studies. In a study with nine experts the authors found that simulation tools which can shorten the evaluation process is considered very helpful. These fndings support our approach to develop our VD-frame that can contribute to shorten the evaluation process and that does not require complex user/player testing to get a frst impression about experiences VDs to be tested can elicit.</p><p>Wuertz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[121]</ref> developed design patterns for awareness cues and showed how awareness cues can be used to adjust e.g., difculty or interface experience. Pereira et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[95]</ref> created a design canvas to assist game designers in conducting an informed game design process which aims at helping e.g., novice game designers to create games with less repetitive game play. Their approach consists of guiding questions with regard to six perspectives, i.e., playfulness, challenge, embodiment, sensemaking, sensoriality, and sociability. We conclude that design patterns and guided design processes can provide support for efective game design, especially for inexperienced designers. However, we also recognize that widely applicable frameworks must leave enough room to allow a design process at a high level of abstraction with as much creativity as possible. Therefore, we decided to keep our VD-frame as open as possible on issues of design creativity, in order to draw a clear distinction between the insights regarding user behavior, which we provide with our work, and the development work of designers, which is not the main focus of our investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESEARCH QUESTIONS</head><p>Results of related work motivated us to develop our VD-frame which allows to defne VDs in terms of their visual characteristics and to allow deductive assessment of VD preferences and experiences VDs elicit in players and user, without having to conduct elaborate user studies in advance <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">108]</ref>. Previous work on visual game interface elements often neglect the ability of perceptual delegation <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">113,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">124]</ref>, which is why we decided to intensify research in this area. Previous approaches to the development of design spaces and frameworks for the description of visual game elements infuenced us, in particular, we considered insights regarding spatial positioning and diegesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">103]</ref>, comprehensibility and learning facilitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, mutability <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[85]</ref>, as well as the bond between game world, virtual character, and player <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref> as these aspects were shown to play a crucial role in the interpretation of game elements and to infuence PUXs. We developed our own terminology and categorization for VDs because previously used categorizations do not always allow unambiguous classifcations <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">82]</ref>. From these fndings, we formulate the following research questions for the development of our VD-frame: RQ 1 To what categories and properties -with regard to their visual characterization -can VDs be generalized? RQ 2 Which experiences are elicited by which VD properties in users and players and what are their VD preferences? The procedures for answering these research questions are discussed in the following sections. For this purpose, VD categories and VD properties were determined based on a game analysis (section 4) to answer the frst research question. For the second research question, a systematic paper analysis was conducted (section 5) to ascertain PUXs which were observed in scientifc user studies investigating specifc VDs. To be able to evaluate VDs more generally, we conducted semi-structured interviews with expert players (section 6) to investigate what VD types are capable of eliciting what kind of PUXs and to determine associated preferences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">VISUAL DELEGATE GAME ANALYSIS</head><p>In this section, we address the answer to the frst research question (RQ 1 ), namely the creation of a generalized framework to describe VDs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Procedure</head><p>We conducted a video game analysis using the same methodology and dataset as Misztal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[86]</ref>, including the results of their investigation, i.e., 67 distinct VD types with 167 VD examples in 102 3D character-centered video games. The authors addressed the question what types of perceptions can be delegated by VDs. In our analysis, we wanted to fnd out the categories and properties of VDs that contribute signifcantly to describing the visual aspects of VDs in general. In advance, based on fndings from related work, we set three analysis questions to examine VDs in terms of their visual characteristics, i.e., (i) where are VDs depicted (spatial positioning but also diegesis), (ii) how are VDs depicted in terms of comprehensibility, and (iii) how does depiction of VDs change (mutability)? We used a grounded theory based approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52]</ref> with three reiterating steps:</p><p>(1) We selected one of the 67 designated VD types for further examination.</p><p>(2) We investigated the VD type using the VD examples given in the mentioned video games, by playing these games or by analyzing game-play videos. In doing so, we continuously tried to answer the three pre-defned analysis questions i, ii, and iii. (3) With each VD added one at a time in each iteration, we tried to fnd diferences and similarities between the VDs already added to the analysis with respect to the three analysis questions i, ii, and iii. This allowed us to distinguish the VDs in terms of their visual aspects in order to form categorizations and properties. Categories should be defned based on the analysis questions (i, ii, and iii). New properties were defned by applying open-coding. Selective-coding was applied to assign visual characteristics of VDs to existing properties. This process terminated when all 67 VD types were analyzed and a valid VD-frame was created that was capable of describing all 67 VD types.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Results</head><p>Three basic categories were established that adequately describe a VD in terms of its visual characteristics, which are relevant for perceptual delegation. The categories were derived from the three analysis questions (i, ii, and iii). Each of these three categories was in turn subdivided into three and fve properties that defne VDs, respectively. According to the resulting framework (VD-frame), a VD can be described by three properties, each of which is assigned to one of the three categories (see table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Categories.</head><p>• Depth: Describes where and with which reference VDs are depicted. • Abstraction: Describes the degree of abstraction in terms of visual depiction. • Control: Describes the way in which VDs can be controlled with respect to their visualization. • Descriptive (DESC): VDs which are conveyed in descriptive form, at a high level of abstraction, e.g., text, numbers, a piece of information whose meaning is derived from a sequence of sub-information. • Symbolic (SYM): Symbolic depictions are abstractions of elements/events/efects from the non-virtual (physical) world, e.g., icons, crosshair, warning symbols, symbols on HUD depicting body parts, e.g., heart, head, brain, body posture. • Naturalistic (NAT): Naturalistic depictions correspond in shape, proportions, and behavior to those in the non-virtual (physical) world or to those in the virtual world, i.e., depending on the viewpoint of the player of the VD-frame and if it serves the analysis. Elements that correspond in their degree of naturalness to the degree of naturalness of the virtual world can also be called natural. Examples are animations, character movements, perspective changes, changing light, shadows, blurred vision that a person experiences in case of vertigo, naturalistic looking blood drops.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.4">Properties of category "Control".</head><p>• No control (NOCO): The system, e.g., the game logic, alone decides on the changeability and appearance of the VD, without any direct interaction of the player/character. Examples are events triggered by game logic, changing light, shadows. • Active (ACT): The players' actions decide on the changeability and appearance of the VD, e.g., the level of a presence bar, depicting weather the virtual character is visible to other entities, changes depending on how the virtual character moves, i.e., fll level decreases when sneaking or increases when running (see also fgure 1). • Modifable (MOD): The depiction of the VD can be permanently adjusted or extended, e.g., by the player equipping the character with skills, which extend the perception abilities. Examples are: red screen flter after being hit disappears faster, the more resilient the character or adjustable animations of the character.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.5">Visual Delegate Framework (VD-frame). VD properties were virtual character.</head><p>ordered based on their associated category.  Presence bar delegates perception of co-presence: is no physical element of the virtual world but references another character who is a physical part of the virtual world (REF) / the presence bar symbolizes attention (SYM) / depending on the players' actions, e.g., hiding or making noise, the fll level changes (ACT); 3. Mini map delegates perception of spatial presence: is part of the in-game menu (MENU) / has descriptive text (DESC), it is also an abstraction of the virtual world (SYM) / we assume that the player can set in the menu which collectables are displayed (MOD); 4. Waypoint delegates perception of spatial presence and distance: is displayed on the interface layer and references physical objects in the virtual world (REF) / contains text (DESC) and symbols (SYM) / position and text changes depending on the players' movements (ACT); 5. Companion delegates perception of co-presence: is part of the physical world (ENV) / companion is naturally depicted (NAT) / we assume that the behavior of the companion can be leveled up through a skill tree, e.g., remains passive or can provide medi-kits or maps (MOD); 6. Map delegates perception of spatial presence: is part of the physical virtual world (ENV) / in the virtual world the map is depicted naturally as a regular physical map (NAT) / we assume that when requesting the map, the map's depiction changes, e.g., spreading the map on the interface layer (ACT); 7. Protecting hand pose delegates perception of pain/health and self-presence: is part of the virtual character (CHAR) / is depicted naturally (NAT) / we assume that when falling down, the hand animation is triggered and can neither be skipped nor controlled (NOCO); 8. Tilted view delegates perception of pain/health: is part of the virtual world (ENV) / is a natural depiction (NAT) / we assume that after falling down, the player camera transformation sequence from tilted view to regular view cannot be controlled (NOCO); 9. Blood drops delegate perception of pain/health: is displayed on the flter (FIL) / we assume that the depiction is rather symbolic (SYM) but can be designed as NAT if the blood drops look like actual blood drops / we assume that when being hit, the blood drops disappear after a predefned time and cannot be controlled directly (NOCO). located in category "Depth" at the very beginning (in table 1 on the far left) before property MENU. Category "Depth": ENV is further away from the player than CHAR, FIL and MENU. REF is between MENU and ENV. Category "Abstraction": The delegation of perception implemented as SYM is more abstract than NAT, DESC is more abstract than SYM. Category "Control": The player has more control over the VD's depiction when it is implemented as ACT compared to NOCO. MOD VDs grant more control than ACT VDs.</p><p>Examples of VD to VD-frame translations are depicted in fgure 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Discussion</head><p>The VD-frame creates clarity where previously only individual cases were considered. This simplifes the consideration of VDs in general and helps with the interpretation of specifc VDs.</p><p>The depth of a VD is crucial for the design process, since with this choice already applicable visualization methods are partly predetermined or partly restricted. The category "Depth" primarily describes the positioning of a VD in which the player as a viewer is the visual reference point from which an imaginary view frustum with a certain depth is spanned. "Depth" also describes the assignment of a VD, e.g., assigned to the character or assigned to the virtual world. Misztal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[86]</ref> distinguished between implicit and explicit VDs comparable to diegesis. They discovered that there are a few VDs for which the classifcation into implicit vs. explicit or intra-diegetic vs. extra-diegetic causes ambiguities which are diffcult to resolve. It has been suggested to extend category building, which we did with our VD-frame. "Depth" shows parallels to the concept of diegesis. MENU VDs are only perceivable by the player, ENV VDs are mostly perceivable by both, player and character. A third set of properties, namely FIL, CHAR, and REF, allows further distinctions. REF VDs transfer information between the virtual environment (ENV) and the in-game menu (MENU). CHAR allows to focus on the character whose visualization plays a crucial role. FIL represents a space which is mostly passive. Ambiguities mentioned are solved with the introduction of the categories FIL, CHAR, and REF as well as with the introduction of further categories, since the question no longer has to be asked whether a VD can be perceived by the character, which players may not be able to distinguish or may not be interested in, which consequently would then have little efect on them.</p><p>We found the degree of abstraction regarding the visual representation of VDs important for the inclusion in our VD-frame. "Abstraction" determines how easily a VD can be decoded when perceived in a game (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>), i.e., how easily players are able to interpret which perception is to be delegated. This infuences for which target group a VD is created, e.g., for novice players or for expert players <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>. Based on this, abstraction in video games can also infuence the optimization of one's own game-play, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref>. "Abstraction" can possibly decide to what extent the player's abilities are promoted in general (rather NAT) or very specifcally towards a certain game (rather SYM). The degree of abstraction can decide which strategy a player adopts or whether speed should be deliberately taken out of the game at certain points (rather DESC). In conjunction with the properties of other categories, we observed that the combination ENV/NAT and the combination MENU/SYM occurred frequently. However, we could not fnd a clear natural dependence. Other combinations were also observed. Nevertheless, the question arises as to what efectiveness other combinations such as MENU/NAT or ENV/SYM achieve with users and players, which we will investigate in further analyses (section 6).</p><p>The introduction of the category "Control" into our VD-frame is crucial because it examines one of the most essential features in games, namely interactivity. Whether interactions of players have infuence on the appearance of VDs should thus be clarifed. During the creation of category "Control", we noticed that the corresponding properties, namely NOCO, ACT, and MOD, cannot always be derived directly from their visualization. The intention of the VD creator must also be taken into account when grouping into this category. For instance, depictions of blood on the interface layer after a character was hit has the VD property NOCO if the blood depiction disappears after a pre-defned time without the player being able to infuence it. The same VD would be ACT if the player could infuence the disappearance of the blood depiction by picking up a medi-kit. The VD would be MOD if the blood disappears faster depending on the character's skill which could be leveled up. On the basis of the visualization, the classifcation into category "Control" is not immediately obvious. It is precisely this approach and possibility that can positively infuence the way of thinking when creating and especially when subsequently adapting VDs. In our analysis, VDs most frequently had the property NOCO or ACT. However, we also included in the VD-frame the rather rarely occurring property MOD, as we consider it to be very interesting and its efectiveness should, in our view, be further investigated to a particular extent. We asked ourselves why in some games a lot of emphasis is placed on being able (as a player) to minutely adjust the appearance of one's own character with the help of a character creator, but some of these adjustments, e.g., the character's face, are not visible at all in some games. Other clearly and permanently visible visualizations, such as the animation of the character's arms or the elements on the interface layer, are only rarely ofered for modifcation and only to a very limited extent, e.g., the possibility to show or hide interface elements, but not their extensive customization. This raises the question of why, to our knowledge, there is no comprehensive VD creator for players to date. We will revisit this question in further analyses (section 6).</p><p>Other aspects were also considered before the formation of categories, but these were not considered further due to their lack of signifcance for explaining the visual properties of VDs. For example, the art style does not play a direct role in our categorization, since art styles are highly dependent on trends and would make the VD-frame less universal and less timeless. However, our VD-frame can incorporate art style when the transformation of a specifc VD into the VD-frame is considered relative to the art style of the whole game. For instance, in a video game that has a comic look and which uses a lot of symbols, an applied VD in category "Abstraction" can be grouped as NAT even if it is symbolic at frst glance. If the rather symbolic looking VD does not difer in style from the degree of abstraction of the rest of the virtual world, then it can be considered natural (NAT) in this virtual world since it does not appear symbolic at all in this symbolic looking world. Here, a thought shift and an accompanying habituation takes place with the player, fostering perception of presence. The same thought shift should then also take place for the translation of a VD into the VD-frame. Thus, scope for the application of the VD-frame is granted, which is important for the later interpretation of the impact of a VD, since the expectations of the players should also be taken into account.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">VISUAL DELEGATE PAPER ANALYSIS</head><p>The established VD-frame (section 4) allows the description of VDs in terms of visual properties. However, the VD-frame does not yet allow an evaluation of the expected PUXs. An evaluation of VD properties is desirable in order to fnd out whether implemented VD properties generate desired experiences and, if not, whether the implemented VD properties should be adapted accordingly. Therefore, the goal of the research described in this section is to fnd out whether there are already fndings in the form of user studies that examine VDs and their properties with regard to their impact on users and players (RQ 2 ). This is done by means of a systematic paper analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Procedure</head><p>We analyzed papers related to the topic of video games and 3D interactive virtual environments with a focus on the last 10 years in particular, but if relevant beyond that as well. The list (see appendix A) of sighted conference proceedings, journals, and magazines contains examined years for each item. The method of our systematic paper analysis is oriented towards the "Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses" (PRISMA 2020) guidelines (methods checklist) <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[92]</ref> which has already been used in other video game related paper review processes in comparable manner, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[99,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">106]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Step 1 (Preselection):</head><p>We have read the title of each paper by ourselves in the mentioned proceedings, journals, and magazines to determine if the paper is related to the topic of visual delegation resulting in including or excluding the paper for further analysis. We searched the title for keywords related to the topic of visual delegation, virtual environments, player/user experience (PUX), and development/design of visual efects and elements. We paid attention to keywords such as graphic(s), head-up display (HUD), infuence, interaction, player/user experience (PUX), sensation, sense, sensory, perception, perspective, (user) interface, (video) games, virtual environment, visual element/efect/feedback. We started with a smaller list of keywords and expanded the list during the analysis. In case we missed a relevant title while manually searching the paper lists in the corresponding databases, we additionally used the keywords for a computer-assisted search. We did not automatically include hits from this search in the list of papers to be examined. Instead, we read the titles of these papers and then decided whether the paper was worthy of further consideration based on their thematic focus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Step 2 (Selection):</head><p>The selected papers from step 1 were further analyzed. We read selected sections of the paper in the following order: abstract, caption of teaser fgure (if existing, teaser fgure was investigated too), conclusions, methodology, results, discussion, introduction. This process was stopped, if possible, as soon as the established selection criteria were already fulflled (see below). However, at least the abstract, the teaser fgure (if existing), and the conclusions were read. If sufcient, further sections, i.e., methodology, result, discussion, introduction, were skimmed or read partially. The selection criteria for inclusion or exclusion of a paper required that (1) the paper examined at least one VD, (2) the paper measured at least one PUX, (3) the paper made a specifc statement about how to interpret the measurement of PUX whereas it was not assumed that the measured PUX was clearly due to the manipulation of a variable corresponding to a category of our VD-frame, (4) the methodology for PUX evaluation should have been a user study, interview, or a meta-analysis.</p><p>If we found additional papers -referenced in a paper that we had analyzed and read -from which we could assume also investigating at least one VD and at least one associated PUX, then we included this paper into our analysis, i.e., applying step 2 on this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.1.3</head><p>Step 3 (Extraction): From each fnal selected paper, the following results were extracted: (1) VD type/method, (2) player/user experience (PUX), (3) VD-frame, (4) reference. During the transfer of each VD into the VD-frame, it was always checked whether this transfer functioned without problems or whether adjustments had to be made to the VD-frame. Consequently, with each additional paper analyzed, a continuous evaluation of the VD-frame took place.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Results</head><p>In the frst step (preselection), 228 papers were selected, 81 papers remained after the second step (selection). 89 VDs were analyzed in association with 77 PUXs. Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2, 3</ref>, and 4 show the results from the third step (extraction). The arrows in the tables indicate whether the corresponding perceived PUXs were decreased (↓), or increased (↑) by the use of the VD, or whether no diference (→) in the investigated PUX could be detected when using the VD. The arrows listed here refect the authors' statements in the investigated papers as to whether a PUX was increased, decreased, or remained the same. If such an assessment by the authors was not available, or only partly available, and if such an assessment could not be derived from the authors' interpretation of the results, then the study data were used to make this assessment, i.e., whether there was signifcant increase/decrease in the means or medians. This was done for the following papers: <ref type="bibr">[</ref> For instance, the authors of the igroup presence questionnaire (IPQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[104]</ref> provide reference values of two video games <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[96]</ref>, e.g., for the sub-scale "experienced realism" (REAL), reference values lie between 1.9 and 2.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Discussion</head><p>As a general result, it can be stated that PUXs can be infuenced with the help of VDs and consequently a more positive experience can be generated. However, the analysis conducted here does not provide reliable information on whether a specifc VD property causally induce a specifc PUX. In some cases examined, the PUX is However, we basically wanted to fnd out which VD characteristics can favor which PUX so that we do not always have to look at the individual case. So we want to create a generalization that reliably predicts the efect of VD types before they have been implemented and tested. Therefore, we need to know causal relationships between applied VD property and elicited PUX. According to the literature currently available, it is not possible to exclude all confounding factors to establish these relationships for a relevant set of VDs.</p><p>The results of this paper analysis are still very valuable. This is because it provides information which PUXs are associated with which VD types and thus also suggest which VD characteristics might possibly favor a particular PUX. This means that for further analyses only a small number of PUXs needs to be investigated, since many irrelevant PUXs can be excluded in advance, which signifcantly simplifes further analysis. Instead of flling the remaining gaps in knowledge with conducting a large number of user studies, we decided to ask for the missing insights directly. Therefore, we conducted semi-structured interviews with expert players.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">VISUAL DELEGATE PLAYER ANALYSIS</head><p>Identifed PUXs from the results of the paper analysis were used in the player analysis to further investigate the second research question (RQ 2 ). Examples of these PUXs are: bond between user/player and virtual character, comprehensibility, interactivity/involvement, visual load, perceptibility, performance, preference. These PUXs were chosen because they appeared more frequently in the paper analysis (section 5), insights from related work showed that they are signifcant (section 2), or because they are considered by the authors to have a strong impact on the overall PUX.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Procedure</head><p>A interview with expert players was chosen as a form of qualitative analysis because it was expected that the target group's level of knowledge and motivation to communicate would be signifcantly greater than what could be explored with a predefned list of questions in a purely structured interview. Consequently, the focus was on uncovering interesting aspects through open conversations that otherwise might have remained hidden. Moreover, this form of qualitative analysis has proven successful in comparable contexts, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.1">Development of Semi-Structured Interview.</head><p>In the process of creating our interview questions, we followed Helferich's guidelines (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref> pp. 179-189). The questions should enable spontaneity, should not ask for factual information which would be answered implicitly throughout the interview, should not set up any narrative expectation, should not be overloaded, should not include too many individual aspects, should facilitate a natural fow of argumentation without abrupt change of topics. The whole set of questions should contain optional questions that can be skipped if necessary, should contain control questions that infuence the pace of the narrative, should leave room for open comments to encourage the interviewees to address the interesting aspects of their own accord.</p><p>Examples of some questions (translated into English) during the conversation about one or more VDs presented to the interviewee using a screenshot: Can you describe the visual elements/methods/effects you see? What do the diferent visual elements/methods/efects elicit in you? What do you think these visual elements/methods/efects are meant to convey? When would a combination of these visual elements/methods/efects be helpful for you? 6.1.2 Selection of Interviewees. The prerequisite for participating in our interview was that the interviewees had several years of active experience in playing 3D video games, e.g., open world, walking simulator, shooter. Participants needed to be game experts to be better capable of interpreting VDs in interactive video games. For the defnition of expert players and their part in our analysis process, we refer to the work of Khaled et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref> according to which the insights obtained through the statements, interpretations and suggestions of expert players personalize the game content to be investigated. This also relates to the so-called "player experience modeling" where the game experience is modeled as a function of the game content on game stimuli, in terms of the player's cognitive and afective responses, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">123]</ref>.</p><p>We recruited our frst participants through convenience sampling and then partially through snowball sampling. Eight expert players participated. Two participants (both women) have a professional background in designing interactive virtual 3D applications and/or (serious) video games. Three participants (all men) have a professional background in developing interactive virtual 3D applications and/or (serious) video games. Three participants (all men) have a professional background in philosophy, sociology, and social sciences, respectively. The participants are aged between 24 and 40 years (M = 32.38, SD = 6.02). According to their own statements, our participants play video games between 3 and 25 hours a week (M = 13.38, SD = 6.32). On a scale from 0 ("I have never played 3D video games") to 6 ("I play 3D video games very often"), our participants rated their previous experience with 3D video games between 4 and 6 (M = 5.5, SD = 0.71) . All participants are not only practically involved with video games by playing them. All participants also deal with theoretical aspects of video games for professional or private reasons, e.g., technical discussions at work, game sciences, consuming critical game journalism.</p><p>6.1.3 Interview Procedure. We contacted our interviewees via email including a frst short introduction to the procedure of the interview. We prepared an online interview by using the BigBlueButton video conference software <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> which we hosted on a server at our university to have full control of the data to be transmitted. The participants could decide whether webcams should be used to see each other or not. Three participants wanted the webcam to be on, the others did not. We adhered to the guidelines set by the ethics board of our institution and we followed the recommendations of Steed et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[109]</ref> for carrying out remote surveys, e.g., compliance with applicable data protection laws, protection of the health of the interviewees, consideration of the spatial situation of the interviewees. At the beginning of the interview, we gave the interviewees a short summary. Participants flled out a declaration of consent including an agreement for processing data acquired during the interview.</p><p>A thematic introduction to the topic of VDs took place, using screenshots showing scenes from video games. In these scenes diferent VDs were presented, which were explained by the interviewer. We used screenshots of scenes from video games in which we presented VDs as examples throughout the whole interview. The selection of VDs presented as well as the selection of video games in which they appear were taken from the VD perception analysis of Misztal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[86]</ref>. We deliberately chose to show participants screenshots rather than video sequences or let them play game scenes for two reasons. (1) due to the extensive experience our participants had, we strongly assumed that they could easily recognize VDs from screenshots, put themselves into the situation of playing a video game including these VDs, and describe their experiences and perceptions in this regard. (2) for our interview it was important to permanently show the VDs to be discussed. A looped video sequence has the problem that it has to be paused or rewound in order to show again the section that is currently being talked about. This procedure interferes with the fow of the interview. In addition, looped videos send out permanent visual stimuli which can be distracting. Manually replaying videos as well as playing game scenes can cause the same problems. Consequently, we considered showing screenshots to be the best solution for enabling a focused discussion, as this still allows to take a look at the VD to be discussed in an unobtrusive way.</p><p>After the thematic introduction, the interview started in which each of the three categories, namely Depth, Abstraction, and Control, were discussed separately. During the interview about each category, all of its properties, namely MENU, FIL, CHAR, REF, ENV, DESC, SYM, NAT, NOCO, ACT, MOD, were discussed. This questioning was not directly related to the properties, but indirectly through the following procedure:</p><p>• First, three or more VD examples were shown one after the other using sample screenshots from video game scenes.</p><p>All three examples belonged to the same category, but each of the examples was assigned to a diferent VD property to allow direct comparison between VD properties in one VD category. In between, we repeatedly interspersed and discussed "regular" visual elements that are not VDs, i.e., visual elements/efects that do not delegate perceptions in addition to the pure conveyance of information. We did this in order to investigate diferences between VDs and "regular" visual elements/efects as well. The interviewees were asked to report completely open on what they see in the example scenes. • Then the interviewees were asked to put themselves mentally into the situation of playing the game from the example image. They were asked what the presented VDs triggered in them, what they perceive and experience playing with these types of VDs. We additionally asked if our participants could name any preferences compared to VDs with contrasting properties, including a ranking. • Attention was paid to whether the PUXs under investigation were mentioned in some form, i.e., bond between user/player and virtual character, comprehensibility, interactivity/involvement, visual load, perceptibility, performance. If necessary, these PUXs were asked for in more detail.</p><p>After looking at exemplary VDs, the same procedure was performed again, but this time by asking about general VD properties. Here, no example scenes from video games were shown. interviewees were asked to recall their previous experience with 3D video games in general. This was done with all categories. Thus, frst a questioning took place on the basis of concrete VD examples on all VD properties of a category. Then, general VD properties were addressed using the same procedure. During the whole interview, both the interviewee and the interviewer were given the opportunity to ask additional questions and, if they were particularly interested, to initiate short discussions. After all categories all properties were discussed (specifc and general), control questions were asked to verify the previous statements of the interviewees. Therefore, examples of VDs were again presented as screenshots, including categories and properties already discussed. If inconsistencies with previous statements were discovered, they were addressed and clarifcation was requested.</p><p>At the end, interviewees had the opportunity to give feedback before ending the interview with a short demographic questionnaire. An interview lasted between 64 and 106 minutes (M = 83.63, SD = 15.91).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.4">Content Analysis.</head><p>In order to answer our second research question (RQ 2 ), we had to condense the results of our interview into a short form that was easier to interpret, without summarizing the content in purely quantitative terms. Therefore, we used a summarizing qualitative content analysis according to Mayring <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[80]</ref> (pp. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[67]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[68]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[69]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[70]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[72]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[73]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[74]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[75]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[76]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[77]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[78]</ref> in seven steps:</p><p>(1) Determination: we described the interview material, we determined what is to be summarized, we determined the units of analysis. (2) Paraphrasing: we re-wrote the interview material in a short descriptive form. (3) Generalization: we generalized the paraphrases according to the level of abstraction, we removed paraphrases which are out of level of abstraction, we added theoretical preconceptions in cases of doubt. (4) First reduction: we removed paraphrases which are similar and insignifcant in content, we added theoretical preconceptions in cases of doubt. (5) Second reduction: we summarized the remaining paraphrases, we added theoretical preconceptions in cases of doubt. (6) Categorization: we created a compilation of the new statements as a system of categories. (7) Re-testing: we started again at step 4 for one further iteration.</p><p>Based on the summary, we were able to extract VD properties and associated experiences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Results</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref> shows condensed results analyzed during the interviews. The quotations listed in the following have been translated into English.</p><p>6.2.1 Category Depth. All participants agreed that FIL VDs would enhance perceived immersion and contribute to develop a bond between player and character. According to interview participant with ID 8 (P8), FIL VDs foster interactivity signifcantly. P3 associates FIL VDs with a sense of urgency. In general, FIL VDs are considered to be indispensable. P3: "It would be if VDs on the 'flter' were because then it would not look solid."</p><p>Besides FIL VDs, CHAR VDs most often caught the attention of our participants. P3 mentioned that CHAR VDs contribute most to character-player bond and that injuries directly to the character's body can also cause stress.</p><p>P3: "In general, things that trigger empathy for me the most are things that you can see directly on the body of the character [...], unlike red [screen] edges or edges with dirt."</p><p>CHAR VDs were criticized for limiting interactivity, for example, when the character's arms make a swinging motion to enhance the perception of running, but no interactivity can be performed with the hands, e.g., aiming. During the interview, while looking at a screenshot of a video game where the virtual character is a White man, P5 mentioned problems identifying with the character.</p><p>P5: "I fnd that problematic. Not all people look like that. What if a woman plays the game or people of color?"</p><p>According to P5, characters should be customizable so that they match the player's appearance, if desired, otherwise a player-character bond can hardly be built. It was argued that MENU VDs have a high probability of visual load and should be presented decently and at the screen edges to be able to pay attention to the virtual world. P8 mentioned a high perceived distance and low empathy to the own virtual character when mostly MENU/SYM VDs are presented. MENU and REF VDs has been taken for granted and habitual, which has also resulted in these elements usually receiving less attention. P2 fnds interface elements grouped on a bar "appropriate" and "clever", since ungrouped elements distributed on the screen cannot be perceived completely. P3 would like MENU VDs to be hidden if they do not contribute anything at the current time. If they are important, MENU VDs should be presented in the center of the feld of view. P4 mentioned, that too many MENU VDs generally result in low perceived immersion and appreciates it when rather few MENU VDs are used. P4: "That's a question of viewing habits. I assume that computer gaming is also a skill that you develop and learn over time, including game situations over time. So over the years, you can also assess these better, so that you don't need quite so much [MENU VDs] in many situations."</p><p>Regarding the omission of all MENU VDs in favor of only ENV VDs, P4 expresses skepticism. During the interview it was noticeable that the participants often mentioned the virtual world but ENV VDs not so much. Still, there was a high agreement that VDs in the virtual world are often preferred.</p><p>P8: "What happens inside the virtual world is what matters most to me. The rest at the edges [on FIL], I do not perceive at all. And that can be left out and that gives me the same picture or interpretation." P1 mentioned that if the game is free of interface elements or hardly uses them, physical, natural elements in the virtual world are more likely to be perceived as inviting to interact with. P3 would fnd it interesting if it were possible to integrate all VDs in the virtual world, but is unsure whether this is even possible. P2 mentioned that ENV VDs should be NAT instead of SYM because they make more sense inside the virtual world. P7 remembers having to learn how to interpret ENV VDs in inexperienced times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.2">Category</head><p>Abstraction. We recognized a rather low preference with descriptive VDs with the exception of a few. Descriptive elements have an efect on P8 when they emotionalize. P8: "When text transports emotions then it contributes immensely to the mood." DESC VDs are also perceived as too direct by some participants and do not contribute to develop a bond between player and virtual character.</p><p>P2: "I have the feeling with descriptive elements that they are too direct and I know that this is a video game. They dictate what I should think or feel. It is almost insulting. If you want to be linked to the character, for example in a very immersive virtual reality game, where you want to project yourself into the character, and their is written that you are sad, that doesn't work for me." P2 distinguished between "regular" DESC elements and DESC VDs and appreciates "regular" DESC elements when they are informative. P2 associates DESC VDs with accuracy. According to P3, DESC VDs are appropriate to learn a game. P7 considers DESC VDs unnecessary, but admits that they can be helpful for novice players who have not yet learned perception delegation more natural VDs provide.</p><p>P7: "As a designer of such elements [NAT and ENV VDs], I feel obligated to design it [VDs] in such a way that it can be understood as directly as possible, without having to use descriptive elements [DESC VDs]."</p><p>It was observed during the interview that almost all participants can ignore symbolic VDs very well and mostly focus on rather CHAR, or ENV VDs. Almost all participants ranked VDs in the same order in the Abstraction category: DESC, SYM, NAT.</p><p>"Symbolic VDs are the more elegant solution, compared to descriptive ones. However, both are unnecessary for me, if the other solutions [natural VDs] already convey the perceptions." However, P7 also mentioned that symbolic elements are justifed when they primarily convey status information that is crucial for the game play, but then they are no longer VDs, which to a considerable extent also convey perceptions. It was emphasized that the comprehensibility of symbolic VDs highly depends on depiction. P3: "Symbolic and descriptive VDs are not so cinematic. They look more like an arcade game."</p><p>Most participants had mentioned that they had seen the full spectrum of very difcult to understand and very easy to understand symbolic VDs in games. P1 associates symbolic elements especially with the transmission of information and less with perceptions to be delegated. Due to P6's strong preference for competitive shooter games, P6 is particularly interested in symbolic elements, since they allow direct information transfer and thus consume little screen space. The learning efort of symbolic elements is not particularly large according to P6, since these would often repeat themselves in video games. P2 associates SYM VDs with accuracy and efciency, more than NAT VDs. P2 prefers a combination of NAT VDs and SYM VDs as a good mixture to foster immersion and information transfer. In fast-paced competitive games, P3 would prefer SYM VDs; in story games, P3 would prefer ENV/NAT VDs, which P3 considers as immersive.</p><p>Most participants mentioned an aversion to natural VDs on the in-game menu (MENU/NAT). Natural VDs on the flter (FIL/NAT) and in the virtual environment (ENV/NAT) were highly preferred by the NAT VDs are described as difcult to understand, because their meaning has to be interpreted frst and some implementations are judged as rather inconsistent compared to the intention. Nevertheless, the majority of the participants mentioned that they are willing to make an efort to learn this kind of perception delegation. In addition, for NAT VDs, the desire was formulated to have them presented as intuitively and easily interpretable as possible. P2 perceives NAT VDs on FIL as very immersive but would prefer a more informative VD (DESC or SYM). P4 mentioned that interactivity with NAT VDs might contribute to develop a bond between character and player. P4 also mentioned that character-player bond development has limits. P4: "I'm abstracting too much there. I'm still in a video game. I am not the character. I might identify with the character through the storyline, through the background, but I'm not the character, I'm just in situation.." P5: "In role-playing games, immersion increases interactivity with others as the party, or group, progresses." 6.2.3 Category Control. Active VDs (ACT) are most preferred by participants. P2 and P3 mentioned that VDs' capabilities of changing the depiction are signifcant and should go hand in hand with the rules of the game, e.g., if a character (perceived form third person perspective) is sneaking, the character's posture should adopt to the the sneaking intention of the player and thus change from a straight body posture to a bent body posture so that the player gets a feedback from the game that the game knows what the player wants.</p><p>MOD VDs are perceived as interesting and according to some participants, they may contribute to develop a player-character bond. However, there is a concern that MOD VDs distract from playing the game and that they are too complicated to use. P7 rejects the possibility of modifability of P7: "I see games as a work of art and I am [as a gamer] a consumer [...]. So I would leave that to the designers. I want to consume it the way it was intended. As a designer, that [MOD VDs] would humble me in my artistic freedom."</p><p>P3 also looked at this aspect from a developer and a gamer perspective and sees it the same way as P7. MOD elements, however, allow control over negative side efect while playing. P2: "If there is the possibility to turn of appropriate efects, then I would use that, for example motion blur, because it makes me feel nauseous."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Discussion</head><p>During the planning of the interview, we were not entirely sure whether it would be sufcient to show only screenshots of game scenes or whether it would be better to present short video sequences. This initial uncertainty turned out to be unfounded in retrospect. All participants knew how almost all VDs are structured and how they behave. Only one participant -the one with the least game expertise -was not quite sure how two of the VDs behaved, but was able to assess the VDs correctly after a little more thought and without assistance. Three participants even reported at the end that the screenshots were a good help to put themselves in the right position and to remember already known and often experienced VDs. The participants were also able to describe VDs in general from memory and without screenshots and to discuss them with us.</p><p>During the video game analysis, we found several examples of video games which use more than one VD at the time to delegate one specifc perception. We addressed this in our interview too. Most participants prefer two VDs for one perception to be delegated where one VD should be designed to emphasize perception delegation, the other VD should rather ensure status information provision without embellishments. This is in line with what Medeiros et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[83]</ref> found out for awareness cues. A third VD is considered unnecessary and rather disruptive. We conclude that the preferred combination of two VDs would consist of one main VD, such as ENV/NAT or FIL/NAT and one supportive VD, e.g., MENU/DESC or MENU/SYM. When combining diferent VDs types to delegate one perceptions, participants expect that especially ENV VDs should behave reasonable and appropriate to the current situation. If this is the case and ENV VDs are comprehensible at frst sight, participants stated that MENU VDs could be discarded from this combination.</p><p>Although participants expressed that they associated REF elements with visual load, we found during the interviews that participants could handle a large amount of REF elements very well. In our estimation, was because participants could easily direct their attention from REF elements to other elements. It was mentioned that an adaptation efect set in that may have contributed to this. Interestingly, participants tended to focus their attention on ENV/NAT and CHAR/NAT VDs.</p><p>Our analyses, especially the paper analysis, show that PUXs can be infuenced with the help of VDs. However, a necessity for the use of VDs to generate a certain level of PUX cannot be derived from this. Nevertheless, the use of VDs in video games is unavoidable due to its strong presence. In serious applications, VDs are used less extensively, which encourages how VDs work in this and other genres.</p><p>Our player analyses show that experienced players have a clear understanding of how VDs can afect them. This might result in a claim that players wish to have VDs presented as precisely and efciently as possible to their customized needs. Our interviews revealed a desire on the part of some players for VDs not only to plausibly delegate perceptions, but also to provide accurate and immediate status information. From this, we believe there will be an increasing desire on the of practitioners to better understand VDs and to be able to develop strategies to continuously improve VDs. Our work on the VD-frame is the frst step in this direction.</p><p>With the help of the VD-frame, a VD can be evaluated in a deductive manner. After translating a VD into the VD-frame, a rough estimate can be made based on the results of the analyses performed as to which PUXs are associated with the analyzed VD and how users/players perceive this VD. After this step, a strategy can be chosen to potentially further enhance the overall experience and player/user approval if needed. Three possible strategies are briefy outlined.</p><p>(1) VD replacement: The VD can be replaced, if needed, by another VD that delegates the same perception but performs better according to the associated PUXs. Sources for suitable VDs that serve as replacements are the VD catalog presented by Misztal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[86]</ref> or comparable video games. (2) VD supplementation: The goal of this strategy is to produce a balanced VD composition. In the analysis it was determined that two VDs can be used for the same perception delegation without being rejected by the users/players. If one VD does not cover all the desired experiences to be triggered, then a second VD could be deliberately chosen as a supplement to fulfll this task. Some interviewees preferred a main VD (e.g., ENV/NAT) and a supportive VD (e.g., MENU/SYM). (3) VD adaptation: This strategy involves upgrading the VD by changing it within a category rather than replacing it completely. For example, a MENU/NAT/ACT VD could be transformed into a MENU/SYM/ACT VD to make the VD more efcient by making it more abstract.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Limitations</head><p>In our analyses, we considered video game and immersive applications that are located in a three-dimensional virtual environment. We mostly left out 2D applications, knowing that for a more complete analysis of VDs this aspect should be considered in future work. We focused on three-dimensional virtual environments, since from our point of view, a bond between user/player and virtual character is benefcial. Phenomena that contribute to this in threedimensional environments are for instance self-presence, i.e., a state in which the user/player perceives the virtual character as once own <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">112]</ref>, or self-location, i.e., the spatial experience of being in a physical or virtual body <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>. These phenomena occur especially in immersive virtual reality (VR) applications, which we also included in our analyses. There are cases where VDs behave diferently in VR than in non-VR applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[88]</ref>, which is also due to the diferent controls, since VR controllers allow direct control of the virtual character's hands. However, there are also individual examples of non-VR applications which allow direct hand control, cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Within these technologies, VR and non-VR, there are also diferent control paradigms, e.g., mouse/keyboard vs. gamepad, data gloves vs. hand gesture tracking, mobile VR for large tracking spaces vs. wired VR for small tracking spaces, which can possibly have an infuence on the user/player perception and experience. Addressing these diferences and possible infuences in future work is another important step to better understand visual delegation.</p><p>We deliberately chose to interview expert players for our player analysis. Due to their extensive experience, expert players have a decided idea of VDs and can therefore describe their experiences comprehensively, which was noticeable in our interviews. Expert players are also a relevant target group for practitioners, as many 3D games focus on expert players. Nevertheless, our selection of interviewees is limiting with respect to a more generalized statement of VDs and their efect on users/players. In future work other groups of people with diferent experience or focus should also be included, e.g., novice players or serious players.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>We explored the question of how a general description of visual delegates (VDs) can be established and how this general description can be used to develop a framework for VD evaluation. Using a game analysis, we created this framework (VD-frame) that spans a generalized scheme that allows a general VD description in terms of VD properties. By conducting a systematic paper analysis and semistructured interviews with expert players, we identifed VD preferences and associated player/user experiences (PUXs). For further application possibilities of the VD-frame, we proposed strategies to improve VDs in terms of its expected PUXs.</p><p>For our future work, we want to expand the knowledge regarding VD preferences and PUXs by conducting more interviews, especially to include the experiences of other groups of people too, e.g., novice players. Furthermore, we want to put our research questions in diferent contexts and diferent genres, e.g., 2D games or serious games. We want to investigate what preferences and experiences "serious" players perceive according to the diferent VD types. By comparing serious players with "entertainment" players, it may be possible to make a prediction about the extent to which VDs fnd acceptance in serious games and enhance them through additional experiences and delegated perceptions. The efects that diferent technologies might have on the impact of VDs should also be investigated further, e.g., VR vs. non-VR. Overall, the goal of all these projects is to further develop the VD-frame in order to be able to make even more reliable statements about visual delegation and their impact on PUXs. This whole process can then be extended to other sensory delegations, such as auditory delegates or tactile delegates, in order to create corresponding frameworks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Examples of visual delegates (VDs) and translation of VDs into the VD-frame. 1.Text delegates perception of pain/health: is displayed on the flter (FIL) / text is descriptive (DESC) / player has no direct infuence on the text (NOCO); 2.
