<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) need to perform numerous self-care behaviors, some very frequently. Pressure reliefs (PRs), which prevent life-threatening pressure ulcers (PUs), are one such behavior. We conducted a qualitative study with seven individuals with severe SCI-who depend on power wheelchairs-to explore their current PR behavior and the potential for technology to facilitate PR adherence. While our participants were highly motivated to perform PRs because of prior PUs, we found that their understanding of how and when to perform a PR difered by individual, and that while they sometimes forgot to perform PR, in other cases contextual factors made it difcult to perform a PR. Our fndings provide insight into the complexity of this design space, identify design considerations for designing technology to facilitate these behaviors, and demonstrate the opportunity for personal informatics to be more inclusive by supporting the needs of this population.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Individuals with severe spinal cord injuries (SCI) may develop a range of impairments and disabilities-such as limited sensation in their hands, arms, elbows, and upper body functions-that necessitate use of power-operated wheelchairs (PWC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">71]</ref>. Irrespective of injury level, individuals who have had an SCI need to follow several life-long self-care routines <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, which are complex to perform for PWC users, often requiring assistance from another individual <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. Pressure relief (PR) is a crucial and frequent self-care behavior. PUs are necessary to prevent pressure ulcers (PUs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">79]</ref>. More than 85% of individuals develop PUs after an SCI, due to life-long wheelchair usage and sitting in the same chair for a prolonged time <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>. PUs often cause hospitalization and result in reduced quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">69]</ref>. Individuals perform PRs to prevent PU by changing their sitting position manually or with the tilt function of their PWC to redistribute the tissue load. Although PRs are relatively simple to perform, the high frequency with which they should be performed-guidelines call for between two and four per hour <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref> -and lack of adequate self-management interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">83]</ref> result in low levels of adherence. Because PRs are important to perform and people fnd the guidelines difcult to adhere to on their own, developing technology to support adherence to PR guidelines has the potential for important impact.</p><p>Unfortunately, current research literature does not provide clear guidance for designing in this challenging context of high-frequency self-care activities for people with a severe SCI. HCI literature has begun to explore self-care behaviors and related assistive technologies for individuals with an SCI and more generally for PWC users <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19]</ref>. That work shows that, although assistive technologies (e.g., tracking) can support the complex self-care behavior of individuals with an SCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, the ability to interact with assistive technologies is limited and challenging, especially for those with severe disabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Recent work also shows that HCI research likely excludes participants with a higher level of SCI, particularly those who have multiple disabilities and comorbidities; thus, their perspectives are not represented in research <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>. Therefore, to design assistive technologies to improve PR adherence-a critical self-care behavior for this underrepresented population-research participation from individuals in the target population is essential. Moreover, building an understanding of their current PR practices can provide insights into their perception, motivation, and psycho-social barriers towards improving high-frequency self-care adherence.</p><p>The goal of this work is to build insights into how technology can better support high-frequency self-care activities by studying how individuals currently engage in PR behaviors and by exploring their reactions to scenarios that illustrate ways technology might support PR behaviors in the future. We conducted semi-structured interviews and a needs-validation study with seven participants who have had an SCI and currently use a PWC. The interview illuminates current behavior, while the "needs-validation storyboards"adopted from the Speed Dating <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[88]</ref> method-help to understand what latent needs users have that technology might address. We collaborated with SCI experts from our university rehabilitation hospital, including a physician, two engineers, and two occupational therapists to develop storyboards for nine imaginary PR-related technology intervention scenarios.</p><p>The results of these eforts exposed that, despite high motivation and PR awareness, participants struggle to adhere to PR guidelines for three main reasons: they have varying and sometimes incorrect understandings of how and when to perform PRs, they have difculty remembering to do PRs in some circumstances, and they encounter situations where performing a PR is difcult either for social or practical reasons. These results also expose important dimensions to consider when designing technology to support PR performance. Our fndings highlight the need for dynamic PR reminders to support building PR routines, expose privacy and social concerns of reminder modes, reinforce the importance of chairable interactions for providing convenient control, identify the need to facilitate autonomy, relatedness and competency, and demonstrate an opportunity to apply a personal informatics lens when designing for this and other self-care behaviors.</p><p>The primary contribution of this work is a deep understanding of the complex factors that infuence how individuals with severe spinal cord injuries perform-or fail to perform-the high-frequency self-care activity of PR and the considerations that designers should make if they intend to build technology to support this behavior. This work also demonstrates an opportunity for personal informatics (PI) tools and approaches to serve individuals who use PWCs, a community that PI research has thus far ignored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>PR is a crucial self-care activity for individuals with an SCI. We explain PR and PU in depth below, review the range of technology designed for SCI self-care routines from an HCI perspective, and summarize the current research on assistive technology for preventing PUs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Importance of PR adherence to avoid pressure ulcers</head><p>PUs are the most frequently acquired secondary complications for individuals with an SCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">75]</ref>. PUs are localized damage to the tissue resulting from prolonged interface pressure due to sitting <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref>. Around 24% of individuals develop PUs within the frst year after an SCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[70]</ref>, and 85% of individuals who have had an SCI have at least one PU during their lifetime <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">70]</ref>. These life-threatening wounds cause an increased risk of infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, complications <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[69]</ref>, and negative impact on quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37]</ref>. Therefore, learning PU risk factors and following strategies to avoid PUs are crucial for people with SCIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref>.</p><p>To avoid PUs, people who use both manual and PWCs need to perform pressure reliefs (PR) by redistributing or repositioning the sitting pressure and tissue load <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">72]</ref>. According to general clinical guidelines, both frequency and duration of PRs are crucial and should be performed regularly: depending on the individual's injury level, typically two to four times per hour for one to two minutes each <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">64]</ref>. Although PUs are one of the most dangerous complications that individuals with an SCI can have <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49]</ref>, PR adherence is typically inadequate <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">83]</ref>. A study on the sitting behavior of full-time wheelchair users found that none of their participants routinely performed PRs <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[76]</ref>. PR performance is typically self-reported both to researchers and clinicians, leading to uncertainty and unreliability in collected data <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">48]</ref>. Taken together, the literature points to a problematic disconnect: regularly performing PRs is very important but adherence to these guidelines is low. This presents an opportunity to explore human-centered solutions that might facilitate better PR adherence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Challenges to routinize and improve PR adherence among individuals with an SCI</head><p>The low levels of PR adherence described above suggest that people encounter challenges when trying to adhere to PR recommendations. However, research has yet to explore in detail what these challenges are. Although individuals with SCIs develop multiple chronic health problems resulting from their SCI that require routine self-care practices-loss of bladder and bowel control, pressure injuries, respiratory issues, and muscle stifness-B 'uy 'ukt 'ur et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> found that PR is least routinized among these self-care activities. The primary reason given is that "completing the activity is bothersome, the consequences are not salient, or the activity is, by nature, one that people easily forget." They also reported that individuals with SCIs develop their own routines of self-care activities (e.g., PR) over time depending on personal, emotional, and social contexts. Sprigle et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[78]</ref> further unpacks barriers to self-care, fnding that people with an SCI encounter contextual changes after acquiring the injury such as returning home after rehabilitation, changes in equipment or home environment, and changes in functional abilities, health, or job status. These changes can impede the routinization or adherence to PR behaviors. In addition to these contextual and behavioral factors, wheelchair selection and usage can impede the routinization and improving PR adherence among individuals with an SCI, including selecting the wrong type of wheelchair, adapting to a new wheelchair, wheelchair adjustments, staying in the wheelchair for long periods of time, malfunctioning of wheelchair equipment, and using the wheelchair in unplanned or undesirable situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. The challenges described above capture at a high level the challenges people might encounter when performing PR, and they suggest that the routinization of PR and improving PR adherence are complex, highly individualized, and dependent on contextual factors.</p><p>This past work provides a strong basis for understanding how difcult it can be to routinize PR behavior, but misses some of the depth and nuance of individual lived experiences with incorporating PR behavior into everyday life over the long term. We build on this past work by engaging with participants who use PWCs to understand their lived experiences with respect to PR. Further, we use this past literature to motivate nine speculative scenarios for how future assistive technologies could help this population adhere to PR recommendations, which we used with participants to elicit deeper insights into the challenges they face. Here, an HCI lens is critical to ensure that assistive technologies for PR adherence are designed and evaluated with a deep understanding of everyday practices and aim to foster refection and awareness through health and contextual information <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[62]</ref>. Our fndings reveal new insights into how individuals difer from each other in their perceptions of PR timing, the way they perform the PR, and additional contextual factors and considerations they encounter when performing PR. Of particular note, our participants explained situations where they did remember to perform a PR, but despite remembering to do it, still avoided performing one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">HCI research with wheelchair users</head><p>While PR performance has not been deeply explored in the HCI literature, wheelchair users have been studied in other contextsincluding physical activity and ftness tracking-that inform our research of performing self-care activities <ref type="bibr">[2-4, 19, 33, 56]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Mason et al.</ref> found that manual wheelchair users often abandon physical activity and health behaviors that are highly visible and do not provide immediate benefts due to the complex norms of social pressure and expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[56]</ref>. Similarly, other research has also found that people with upper body impairments, especially those who use PWCs, often discard or choose not to use health and ftness tracking technologies because technology is not always accessible <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">53]</ref> or they feel it will make them stand out or feel abnormal <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. Gerling et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> found that users' diferent levels of disabilities impact their level of control over their PWC; that work focused on game design, but the fndings suggest that technology designed for this population must consider a variety of individual factors and accommodate a range of users' functional abilities.</p><p>Carrington et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> explored the concept of chairable form factors for PWC users to accommodate an individual user's abilities and needs. The main idea of chairable technology is to integrate input and output systems into the body of the wheelchair in a oneof, individualized confguration. The fndings illustrate a variety of design considerations for implementing chairable interfaces, and also underscore the role of the wheelchair as a very personal item, which at least one participant described as their "home. "</p><p>The human-centered work described above reveals important fndings that inform the design of technology for power-wheelchairuser populations, but a gap remains between this work and the self-care fndings of B 'uy 'ukt 'ur, et. al. described earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>. How might the combined insights from research on how users inhabit and interact with wheelchairs and research on lower-frequency self-care activities come together to better support high-frequency self-care activity of performing 30 to 50 PRs per day? There are likely diferent considerations to account for in the context of this higher-frequency activity, which is a core focus of this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Assistive and Tracking Technologies for improving PR adherence</head><p>Despite the lack of deep human-centered insights on barriers to PR performance, clinical researchers have developed and deployed assistive technologies that aim to reduce the risk of developing PUs among individuals with an SCI by providing PR reminders <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref> or by employing assistive mechanisms that reposition the wheelchair to perform a PR <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">82]</ref>. Clinical research on PR adherence has also investigated a broad range of prevention tools including educational materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">66]</ref>, feedback through mobile applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">74]</ref>, interface pressure mapping (IPM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">87]</ref>, electrical stimulation for improvements in tissue tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">45]</ref>, and tele-medicine programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[67]</ref>. None of these approaches have independently led to sustained improvement in PR adherence, which suggests that the barriers to PR adherence are not yet well-enough understood.</p><p>Prior research has also shown that assistive technologies often fail to facilitate adherence to health behaviors due to a combination of behavioral and physiological factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">82]</ref>. Assistive technologies often act as symbols of stigma and barriers for people with disabilities to interact socially, as they do not meet normative expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">58]</ref>. Thus, to improve PR adherence, there is a need for personalized solutions that address the contextual factors impacting an individual's PR performance including in social contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">82]</ref>. The eforts above to develop assistive technology to support PR adherence do not engage a human-centered perspective. People's own perspectives on their PR behavior are currently missing in the literature, and these human-centered insights can provide invaluable guidance to develop future technology or other interventions to facilitate PR adherence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Adopting a human-centered perspective for PR adherence</head><p>Individuals who have had an SCI and use a PWC are underrepresented in HCI research and in technology-based tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">43]</ref>.</p><p>In particular, we are unaware of any human-centered research to assess user needs for facilitating PRs, which are a crucial self-care behavior. It is essential to understand diferent personal and contextual factors and barriers such as source of motivation, level of awareness, perception, process, and surroundings <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">68]</ref> that can lead to variations in PR performance. However, due to a higher level of injury, the position and reachability of assistive technology is especially critical for PWC users <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31]</ref> and must be considered while designing assistive technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>. A key objective of this work is to understand the potential for technology to assist this population with adopting and maintaining PR behavior and explore their needs to improve PR adherence. In this study, we aim to address the following research questions:</p><p>RQ1 What are the current PR practices of individuals who sustained an SCI and are dependent on a PWC? RQ2 What design considerations are important when designing technology to improving PR adherence?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">STUDY DESIGN</head><p>This study combines semi-structured interviews and needs-validation storyboards from the Speed Dating method <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">88]</ref> to explore our two research questions. We chose these methods-and adapted them when necessary-to be appropriate for participants who had an SCI and diferent disabilities and comorbidities, in response to guidance from the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">50]</ref>. In this section, we describe how we designed our storyboards through an iterative process with stakeholders, considerations in our method for this participant population, our data collection, and our analysis process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Iterative storyboard development</head><p>To design a range of possible scenarios to help understand our target users' needs, we adopted the needs-validation storyboard approach from the Speed Dating <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">88]</ref> method. In Speed Dating, researchers use storyboard scenarios to investigate participants' needs, experiences, interactions and preferences.

We adopt the Speed Dating method in our study to elicit users' reactions, not to propose technologies that we should build. Speed Dating is an especially good ft for this work as it enables participants to critically refect on their needs and constraints in the context of the scenarios provided without the burden of real technological implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[88]</ref>. However, for this method to be efective, the choice of scenarios and the way they are portrayed in storyboards are both critical. In this subsection, we describe our iterative storyboard design process.</p><p>We started the brainstorming process by identifying two primary sites for interaction: 1. mobile applications, since past work on PR reminders focused on mobile applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">86]</ref>, and 2. interactions integrated with the wheelchair itself, drawing inspiration from Carrington et al. 's insight on the potential for chairable interfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. Within each category, we identifed diferent approaches to supporting PR that would be appropriate for that platform, drawing inspiration from past literature (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. For mobile-application based scenarios, we identifed reminder notifcations <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[86]</ref>, virtualcoaching and feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">74]</ref>, self-goal-setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, and collaborative tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref>. For wheelchair-based scenarios we identifed vibration reminders <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>, visual reminders using a blinking light <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, head mounted audio notifcations <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">87]</ref> and a pressure sensing sitting mat <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>. Using this literature, we worked with our expert collaborators-a physician, two engineers, and two occupational therapists (OTs), all of whom work with individuals with SCIs-to brainstorm 14 PR-related technology-based scenarios.</p><p>To increase the empathetic connection between participants and our scenarios, we followed guidance on speed dating <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> and developed fctional stories around the approaches listed above. For each scenario, we discussed the specifc literature with our collaborators and decided on the stories. For instance, the scenarios based on a vibration reminder (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) in the wheelchair armrest (scenario S1), and blinking light reminders in diferent parts of the wheelchair body (scenarios S2 and S7) for doing PR were inspired by Carrington et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref> chairable form factors. One OT collaborator noted the importance of water intake for reducing the risk of PUs. That inspired us to imagine a blinking light in the bottle-holder that is integrated into the PWC (scenario S7). Similarly, in scenario S5, the idea of collaborative tracking came from B 'uy 'ukt 'ur et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref> and our physician collaborator suggested that he thought his own patients might be interested in tracking with intimate partner-an idea that we integrated into S5.</p><p>We tweaked the stories to accommodate diferent triggers, notifcation modalities, interaction mechanisms, purposes (e.g., reminders, feedback, increase motivation), and contexts (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>). We identifed diferent contexts for these stories to take place in, varying factors including: location (in a public place or at home) <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[59]</ref>; social context (alone or around/with other people) <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[56]</ref> and concurrent activities (busy with work or sleeping-suggested by the expert collaborators). We converted these scenarios into storyboards that we illustrated using license-permissive pictures of individuals using PWCs. We used Adobe Photoshop to apply a flter on the images to make them more abstract with the goal of supporting participants to imagine being in those situations themselves.</p><p>We received multiple rounds of feedback on our storyboards from our expert collaborators. In particular, the OTs indicated that nuanced details about the type of wheelchair depicted and the blurring of a wheelchair user's face might be negatively interpreted by participants. We adjusted the storyboards in response to be sure we were portraying realistic PWCs and that we were not blurring faces. We also conducted two pilot studies with two researchers who had each worked with an SCI population for more than three years. Our experiences in both pilot sessions led us to reduce the number of scenarios to minimize participation fatigue. We reduced the scenarios from 14 to nine. To do this we identifed repetitive concepts-vibration reminder and audio notifcation in the outdoor environment, blinking light in the wheelchair armrest, sharing PR data with partner through mobile application and mobile notifcation in diferent places inside home. We removed those repetitive storyboards to retain a broad range of diferent scenarios. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> shows the technology dimensions of our fnal storyboard design, and all nine can be found in the supplemental materials associated with this paper. We also provide detailed tracing of all of the sources of the fnal scenarios in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Recruitment</head><p>Our recruitment process started in March 2021. We recruited seven participants (six male and one female) who had an SCI and used a PWC. Our collaborators at the rehabilitation hospital helped this effort by posting our recruitment materials on their monthly newsletter (a broad distribution newsletter focused on active living for individuals who have had an SCI) and on their Instagram page to reach out to the potential participants. The inclusion criteria were:</p><p>(1) 18 years or older, (2) had an SCI in the past, (3) use a PWC, (4) is capable of making informed consent, and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) not currently an inpatient in an acute care or rehabilitation hospital. Notably, the newsletter recipients and the Instagram page members are geographically distributed across North America.  <ref type="figure">--:=-------:=--------</ref>   We received eleven total recruitment responses between March and June 2021 and identifed seven of those respondents as people who entirely depend on PWCs for mobility (the other four use both manual and PWC). PWC usage was important in this context, as PR behaviors difer substantially between PWC and manual wheelchair users. While more participants would have been desirable, literature on doing research with an SCI population cautions that there are many barriers to participation for these participants, and recognizes the importance of every individual's perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>. Thus, we determined that seven participants was an acceptable number.</p><p>We collected participants' verbal consent to participate in our study as approved by our institution's IRB. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows basic information about our participants, who had a diverse range of injury levels and comorbidities, multiple histories of PUs, diferent periods of time since their initial SCI, and diferent experiences with PWC. Each participant was compensated with a $15 Amazon gift card for participation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Study Procedure</head><p>We conducted all study sessions over Zoom [89] both to comply with university and federal COVID-19 guidelines, and to facilitate reaching our geographically dispersed set of participants. We scheduled the sessions according to participants' convenience-two were rescheduled due to participants' medical emergencies. All communication was email-based except for P7, who preferred text messages. We conducted semi-structured interviews frst, followed by the needs-validation storyboard session. We shared our storyboard slides with participants using the Zoom screen-share feature. We ofered participants a break or the option to schedule another time for the needs-validation study if they felt fatigued; all preferred taking small breaks (2 to 5 minutes) for PR and continued with the study. We did not explicitly collect any clinical information on participants' injury, ability, or comorbidity during or before our study; we report information that participants voluntarily shared during the session or while demonstrating their PR practices (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>). Our study procedure was approved by the University of Utah IRB.</p><p>The semi-structured interviews focused on how participants learned about PRs, current PR behaviors, their confdence in those behaviors, and personal and contextual barriers in performing PR. The full set of questions are in supplemental materials. We started with demographic information including age, gender, occupation (if any), year of SCI, PU history, number of years using PWC, and their estimate of average time spent in the wheelchair per day. We also asked about other self-care or non-health-related behavior tracking and their frequency of smartphone and personal computer usage per day (ranked on a scale of 0 to 5) (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>). In the needs-validation study, participants shared their reactions to the scenarios and their associated perspectives that they felt informed their reaction, such as: convenience, preferences, thoughts on how variations of the scenario might change their reaction, and barriers that they foresaw for each storyboard scenario.</p><p>While collecting demographic information, we identifed that P3 and P4 had some speech difculties. We confrmed this with them and adjusted several questions to accommodate shorter responses, following guidance from the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>. P3 and P4 each sometimes shared their perspectives using only a few words ( "vibration best" (P3), "only missed reminder" (P3), "cannot feel armrest" (P4), etc.). We looked out for situations where we inferred additional information based on their short answers, and followed up to confrm our assumptions and interpretations by asking similar questions: "among all the other modes, do you prefer vibration most?" (P3), "do you want reminders for each PR?" (P3); and received "yes" or "no" answers. The average duration of each session was 65 minutes. We recorded all sessions using Zoom's recording feature with the permission of our participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Data Analysis</head><p>We transcribed the Zoom recordings using Otter.ai <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[63]</ref> and employed inductive thematic analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> to analyze transcribed data. We started by reading through the seven transcripts (interview and storyboard study) carefully and coding the transcripts in spreadsheets. One researcher coded the transcripts and progressively discussed the codes with each of the other two researchers. We extracted a total of 670 codes from the seven transcripts. Next we transferred all codes into digital sticky notes using the brainwriting function of Miro <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[57]</ref>. Two researchers grouped all the codes in Miro iteratively. We identifed 26 themes from the several iterative rounds of analysis, such as "worst scenario for PR", "reminder should be private", and "independence is preferred". After each iteration, we reviewed the grouping as a research team to verify consistency and made adjustments when necessary. By the end of the process, we had consolidated 10 high-level themes to answer our research questions. For RQ1 (current PR practices), we generated six themes on PR-related activities: motivation and awareness, perception, remembering, performing, barriers, and uncertainty with current practice. For RQ2 (design guidelines for improved PR adherence), we identifed four themes: purpose, modalities, interaction, and social-setting.</p><p>Additionally, while doing the inductive analysis, we found that the codes under the theme of social-setting refected participants' need for: independence and autonomy; connectedness with their family, friends, caregivers and therapists; and to have and demonstrate confdence and competence in their PR behaviors. During this analysis we recognized the similarities of these codes to the core concepts of Self-Determination Theory (SDT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[73]</ref> -concepts of autonomy, relatedness, and competence for "people's inherent growth tendencies and innate psychological needs for their self-motivation and personality integration" <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[73]</ref>. Thus, even though we approached our analysis following an inductive coding process, we report the theme social-setting through the lens of the SDT concepts of autonomy, relatedness, and competence to facilitate better connections with the literature. The next section describes the resulting themes of our inductive thematic analysis in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">FINDINGS</head><p>Our fndings revealed a wide variety of current PR practices, refections on those practices, and reactions to the scenarios portrayed in the storyboards we presented. Participants communicated a complex set of factors that impact their PR performance, and important considerations for technology that aims to support that performance. We discuss these fndings below in more detail. We frst discuss RQ1-current PR practices (section 4.1), then RQ2-factors for design implications (section 4.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Current PR practices</head><p>All of our participants had previously developed PUs on multiple occasions. As a result, all participants stated they are highly motivated to improve their PR adherence, driven by their own prior experience of the pain and misery of a PU and the fear that they would develop another. However, diferences in their understanding of how and when to perform PRs, difculty remembering to perform PRs, and contextual factors that put them in inconvenient and awkward scenarios made participants uncertain about their current PR adherence and the potential to sustain future PUs. We discuss these themes to answer RQ1 in the following subsections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Fear of PUs motivates PR awareness and lifestyle changes.</head><p>For all participants, fear of PU, pain, and sufering are the biggest motivation for improving PR behavior. For instance, the pain and misery of PU drive P1, P2, P3 and P6 to do timely PRs: "it's fear that keeps me doing it" (P1). Likewise, P4, with a current PU, is very concerned about doing PRs correctly to avoid another PU. P5 observed that "people will not get the importance of PR until they get some pressure ulcers". Additionally, P1, P4, and P5 have each endured the miserable experience of having fap surgery 1 , fueling additional fear of PU. P5 had to wait for a year for the surgery schedule, making her skin and bone very fragile in that PU area. Furthermore, P7 has had a PU on his back continuously for the last two years, forcing him to spend long periods of time in bed and signifcantly diminishing his quality of life. Thus, fear of PUs motivates all participants to be aware and prioritize PR schedules in many situations, for example while in vehicles, out in public, and during meetings at work:"if I'm in a store with my family, I gotta stop, [and do PR], or if I'm in the car when it's time to do a pressure release, you know, ... whoever is driving, pull over" (P1)</p><p>In addition to performing PRs, participants also adopted other changes to avoid further PUs, including: reducing wheelchair sitting duration (P1, P2, P4, P5, P6), obtaining or replacing customized wheelchair cushions and backrests (P1, P3, P5, P6, P7), changing ,..   Additionally, P5 takes extra cushions during long drives, and P7 quit smoking to hasten recovery from a PUs. Furthermore, while sleeping, participants (P2, P4, P6) keep themselves reclined in the wheelchair for a more even pressure distribution. Thus, each participant enacts their own set of strategies to make changes in their lifestyles to prevent future PUs.</p><p>4.1.2 Understanding of how and when to perform PR varies dramatically. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> shows how participants' understanding of PR difered from each other and that they learned about PR from different sources. Participants' understanding of how to perform a PR evolved and varied as well. For instance, P1 and P5 recalled that PRs should be performed once every hour (well below current medical guidelines); P2 and P4 believe they should perform PRs every 15 minutes; P3 and P7 said they should do one every half an hour; P6 responded that once in every four hours would be enough for him. Similarly, participants have diverse perceptions regarding PR duration. Rather than representing participants' real-world behaviors, these represent what participants understand to be the ideal PR behavior. Thus, not having consistent resources and being on their own after being discharged from their rehabilitation hospital made considerable diferences in PR their understandings of how and when to perform PR. In contrast, P2 relies only on his internal sense of time and does not check a clock; he acknowledged that he ends up forgetting PR frequently. Likewise, P5 and P6 both noted that PR has become more routinized for them because of their long-term experience with their SCI, and thus that they do not think about it explicitly-P6 keeps his PR goal in mind: "it's [PR] in my head, it's becomes ingrained"; and P5 does PR whenever she remembers:"I often don't think about it [PR] and all of a sudden, it's like, oh, yeah".</p><p>With some sensation in the back, many participants (P1, P2, P5, P6, P7) primarily remember to do a PR when they feel pain, spasms, or other irritation. For instance, P1 can feel the pain if he does not do PR for a long time. Similarly, P2 can feel the pain and does PR accordingly:"when I kind of in a little bit more pain or a little bit more irritated... That's when I'll go ahead and do a pressure relief". Thus, participants follow their own intuition or body signals to remember PR without any reminder or tracking technology, leading to irregular PR performance that is below medical guidelines. Participants acknowledged this and noted that they would like to adhere to the guidelines better, but were unsure of what additional strategies to employ that would increase adherence.</p><p>4.1.4 PWC tilting functionality aids PR, while manual PR processes are burdensome and irregular. Five participants use the PWC's tilt function for PR with either hand-controlled (P1, P2, P3, P6) or mouth-controlled (P4 3) joystick (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>). Among them, P1, P2, P3, and P4 depend on the wheelchair tilting functionality to perform PR: "PR was almost impossible without [a] tilting PWC" (P1). P2 also uses a reclining bed for performing PRs.</p><p>In contrast, P5, P6, and P7 perform PRs manually in diferent ways, which are burdensome and lead to even more sporadic PR performance. For instance, P7 does not have a tilting function in his PWC due to lack of insurance coverage. He thus repositions himself by tilting his head back or legs out and moving cushions around. That makes doing PR burdensome and demotivating, and this manual approach is likely to lead to improper PRs. P5 and P6 each lift themselves for a few seconds (well below recommended duration) and change sitting posture and position often by reaching forward to redistribute the pressure. These manual PR methods are burdensome, thus leading to PRs that are being performed incorrectly, and even less frequently: "even with my experience [of PUs], I don't do it [PR] every hour" (P5). Whether by necessity because of lack of tilting functionality (P5 and P7) or personal preference (P6), performing manual PRs represents an additional barrier to proper PR performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.5">Loosing track of time or skipping PR for inconvenience or awkwardness.</head><p>All participants expressed that they did not meet PR guidelines for a variety of practical reasons, either by accident by loosing track of time or purposefully skipping PRs because of inconvenient times or places or social awkwardness associated with performing a PR (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>).</p><p>Failing to keep track of time. All participants stated they often forget to perform PRs because they lose track of time. For instance, when away from home, P1 does not have a clock in front of him, P3 cannot easily see the time on the wheelchair screen in the daylight, and P6 loses track of time when focusing on other things outside the home. In contrast, P2 and P7 often forget PR at home when focused and busy with their work, phone, or computer: "when I'm playing on my phone, doing my own thing [at home] that's kind of when I forget to do pressure releases" (P7). P5 forgets about PR both inside and outside the home due to losing track of time, diferent distractions, and being busy with phones and computers. Notably, P4-who has speech difculties-also loses track of time both inside and outside the home; however, did not provide a specifc reason on this point and preferred to move to the next question.</p><p>Inconvenient times during other health behavior. Three participants (P2, P4, P5) deliberately avoid PRs at inconvenient times-during lunch or breakfast time (P4) because of disturbance in eating; while a water cup or bottle is on the wheelchair (P2) as water may spill with the wheelchair tilting, and in the evening time (P5) due to tiredness after being in the wheelchair the whole day. Moreover, sleeping, participants (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6) avoid PR because they prefer not to wake up.</p><p>Inconvenience due to insufcient space. P1 and P7 are uncomfortable doing PR in public places because performing a PR takes space and when in public they are unsure of their surroundings. P1 avoids PRs in church, shopping malls, or in transit due to lack of space: "I always make sure I'm someplace where I'm out of [other people's] way, and it's not gonna be a problem [to tilt]". Similarly, doing PRs in vehicles or shopping malls is uncomfortable for P7. ". . . I had to go up on a paratransit bus (wheelchair accessible bus). And I needed to tilt [PR], the guy [bus driver] started getting kind of mad ... In any transit, you know, even [in] my van, there is just no room [for PR]" (P7).</p><p>Doing a PR in public is socially awkward. Six participants (P1, P2, P3, P5, P6, P7) acknowledged that performing a PR in front of other people is socially awkward (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>), and that they often skip PRs for this reason. P1, P3, and P6 explained they previously felt embarrassed to tilt publicly, but that after many years with an SCI, having had multiple incidents of PUs and associated pain led them to worry less about what other people think: "... if they [people] ask questions [about PR], that's fne. But I don't really care...First, I worried about what it would look like but then I went, 'No way. It doesn't matter"' (P6). P5 further explained the awkwardness: "that's not comfortable for some people to recline like that [in front of people] or for too long. "</p><p>With more recent SCIs, P2 and P7 still feel awkward doing PR publicly and purposefully skip PR or avoid certain public places for embarrassment. For instance, P2 avoids doing PRs during meetings or important conversations so as not to distract people around him: "I would be really unlikely to probably do it [PR], unless, I would be in the back of a room or something like a presentation is going on". Likewise, P7 avoids going to stores to buy clothes or other items   Thus, in every situation where an individual is in public, they are forced to weigh their own self-care against feeling as though they are acting in a socially inappropriate way. This calculation inevitably leads to skipped PRs, thus sacrifcing self-care to accommodate the comfort of others around them. It even leads P7 to limit his participation in society to avoid these awkward situations. Although some participants (P1, P4, P5, P7) feel less embarrassed to do PR around friends and family who know the importance of PR, the tension between ingrained awkwardness to tilt publicly and the fear of PUs and pain impose a constant mental burden that impedes the PR routine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.1.6</head><p>Recurring PUs create uncertainty regarding current PR behavior. Despite increased motivation, increased awareness, and lifestyle changes, repeated PUs cause participants (P1, P2, P4, P5, P6, P7) to question their current PR behavior. For example, even though P1 times his PRs using the clock, he has still had multiple PUs. That makes him uncertain about his PR frequency: "sometimes the reality of what you think you're doing and what you're actually doing can be diferent". Similarly, P5 and P6 stressed that they know they should do PR more frequently. P2's uncertainty makes him believe that he should do something more for proper PR: "I'm uncertain that [PR frequency and But also method [tilting function]... I would say that I am skeptical of how much of a pressure release I'm getting when I fully tilt and recline my wheelchair. I feel like that I should probably be doing something more" (P2). After developing recent PUs, P4 and P7 both became concerned that they do not perform enough PRs. Moreover, P7 lost insurance and has been unable to obtain a tilting PWC; his complete dependence on manual methods to perform PRs further increases his uncertainty. Taken together, despite high levels of motivation and PR and having made lifestyle changes-repeated PUs make participants uncertain about their current PR behavior. struggle adhere to PR guidelines, and are not confdent in how close or far they are to meeting those guidelines. Thus, there is an unmet need for supporting awareness of PR behaviors and adherence to PR guidelines. There is the potential for technology to better support that need, which we explore further in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Factors to consider when designing technology to support PR adherence</head><p>From our analysis, we developed four themes to answer RQ2: Factors to consider when designing technology for improved PR adherence. We surfaced that: (1) participants want to receive PR reminders, but only for unaccomplished, incomplete or incorrect PRs;</p><p>(2) modalities should be private, ability-based, and contextaware;</p><p>(3) a chairable system is more convenient than a smartphone for most participants; and (4) system should facilitate autonomy, relatedness and competence. See table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref> for an overview these dimensions. We discuss each theme in the following sub-sections. that kind of a thing as opposed to going through each time"(P2). Thus, there is not a one-size-fts-all solution here-participants difer in the functionality and the frequency of interaction that they would want from a system designed to support PR performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.2.2</head><p>Reminder modalities should be private, ability-based and contextaware. Participants expressed preferences for how they would like reminders to be delivered. Private and unobtrusive: Six participants (P1, P2, P4, P5, P6, P7) prefer PR reminder modalities to be private and unobtrusive so that others around them do not know about the reminder: "I don't think I would want something that people around me could see that I'm being prompted to do something" (P1). Thus, vibration in the armrest was the top choice as a reminder mode for anyone who would have the sensation to feel it in their arm (P2, P3, P5, P6, P7). P2 stated the vibration mode as "the most efective reminder"; P5 thinks "nobody even knows you kind of have a problem" and P6 mentioned "It's personal. It's not intrusive at all to the social setting". In addition to that, participants do not want the reminder system to be distracting to other people like a loud audio notifcation (P1, P2) or a highly-visible blinking light in the wheelchair body (P1, P2, P5, P6) that would draw attention to them from other people.</p><p>Ability-based: Accessibility of reminder modalities is another major concern for participants (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7). For instance, P1 and P4 cannot vibration in the armrest because they lack upper-body sensation. Instead, they prefer a visual reminder, such as a small blinking light-at joystick area, that will only be noticeable by them: "That [blinking light] would be a good reminder for somebody like me that cannot feel anything: Visual, something visualthat only I can see" (P4). Additionally, due to complications from brain surgery, P3 will be unable to notice the blinking light outdoor unless the light is bright enough: "...if it's not very bright. I probably wouldn't see it". Similarly, P5 and P6 emphasized the importance of ability-based notifcations, including the idea of vibration in the wheelchair headrest (P5) or adjusting the vibration to be stronger (P6) for people with less sensation in their arms.</p><p>Context-aware: Five Participants (P2, P3, P5, P6, P7) suggested combining reminder modes when outdoors because a single-mode (vibration, blinking light, or audio notifcation) can go unnoticed in a noisy and distracting outdoor environment. For instance, P2 wants the vibration reminder with a fash of light at the train station or outside his home. Similarly, P5 and P6 prefer combining vibration and a blinking light together: "there's just so many distractions outdoors.. and unless it was nighttime, you might not even notice blinking light" (P5); "There are so many vibrations in the chair itself when it moves, the vibration reminder can get unnoticed"(P6). Likewise, P3 would like audio reminders with the vibration or blinking light outdoors because might fail to recognize the other reminder modes. Additionally, P7 volume control of the audio notifcation depending on the outdoor surroundings: "If you're outside, it's going to be pretty loud. right? If you're on the street or shopping and stuf, we would have to be a little bit raised. I mean, you could have it's just a volume key [to control the notifcation]" (P7).</p><p>P6 and P7 described preferred reminder-mode combinations for indoor contexts as well-while playing games or sleeping, blinking light may go unnoticed (P7), or the vibration or audio notifcations in the library or during a meeting will disturb others (P2). Thus, the user's current context infuences what the most appropriate notifcation mechanisms are. While this is true across the general population of smartphone users, the consequences of a disruptive notifcation can be more signifcant for someone with a disability who is subject to additional stigmatization.</p><p>A chairable system is more convenient than a smartphone for most participants. Participants described what kind of technological interaction they would prefer.</p><p>Inconvenience with a mobile-based system. Four participants (P1, P2, P3, P5) mostly ignore or turn of their mobile notifcations, so they would not receive a real-time PR reminder delivered through their mobile phone: "I turn of all my notifcations on my phone anyway. I probably wouldn't see it [mobile notifcations] in real-time, it would be something that I wouldn't see until many hours later" (P2). For these participants, a mobile phone is not an ideal platform for time-sensitive information, such as a timely PR reminder.</p><p>However P4, who has less hand functionality, prefers a mobilebased reminder system. His phone is mounted to his wheelchair and he operates it with his mouth (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>); this transforms the phone into a chairable companion tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> which is an ideal platform for a reminder system.</p><p>Convenience in a chairable system. All participants prefer the reminder system to be incorporated in the wheelchair-either by being built into the chair itself or through a wheelchair-mounted smartphone-because they anticipate it would be less burdensome, convenient, and controllable. For instance, P5 and P6 expressed that there are too many things to remember, so they do not want some additional device or activity for PR reminders will require extra efort. Thus, a vibration reminder in the wheelchair-armrest (P3, P7) or the joystick (P7) will be easy and convenient. If a blinking light is used as a PR reminder, P1, P2, P4, and P6 prefer it somewhere around the joystick area to be easily reachable and controllable.</p><p>Integrating reminders with manual goal-setting and automatic tracking. Participants expressed that chairable reminders with manual goal-setting (P1, P2, P4, P5, P6, P7) and automatic tracking (P1, P3, P5, P6, P7) would be efective in supporting their PR adherence. For instance, a one-time setup for auto-tracking would be more straightforward and helpful for P5 and P6, and they would not need to remember the PR count. Additionally, supporting user-driven goal setting was perceived increase autonomy (P5 and P6), because auto-tracking will count the accomplished PR, and reminders will notify them when they should take action to ensure they achieve their goal. Similarly, P7 noted that the combination of manual goal setting and auto-tracking would help him to improve PR adherence: "...it would show you how many [PRs] you did that day, How many times you got your goal that week, ... it being an automatic input, You can't lie. so..yeah, I'll remember to do my pressure relief". (P7). Thus, to improve PR adherence, participants are most interested in chairable interactions with manual goal setting and automatic tracking.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.2.4</head><p>A system should facilitate autonomy, relatedness and competence. Participants expressed psychological needs that a system should facilitate. During analysis, we recognized that the needs we observed during our inductive coding process were consistent with Self-Determination Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> concepts of autonomy, relatedness, and competence.</p><p>Fostering independence and autonomy. All participants wanted to be able to control any future system's modes, timing, and response missed PRs, and they do not want to depend on others for PR-related activities: "Because I'm a very independent person and like to have control of my own surroundings" (P4). Additionally, no participant wants to involve or rely on others to decide when to do a PR or hold others responsible their PUs: "...that gives me a little bit of independence. I just don't want to ofoad that responsibility to somebody else. Just because then I get a pressure sore. Why don't you remind me? Yeah, I don't want to put myself in that situation" (P1). Instead, all participants prefer a reminder system that would facilitate their independence and autonomy: "just a little something [reminder] and then you don't have to rely on other people" (P5).</p><p>Facilitating relatedness. Four participants (P2, P4, P6, P7) identifed that, while they wanted to maximize their own autonomy in performing PRs, that integrating friends and family members into the process in some ways could provide a sense of inclusion and relatedness. P6 thinks PR a routine activity; therefore, having occasional reminders from friends would be a way to include them in his life. Similarly, P2 and P7 would appreciate some friendly reminders from their close friends and family to normalize the PR practice within their social environment. P6 and P7 would like some occasional notes or reminders from their caregiver or therapist for "positive infuence" (P6) and "being in touch" (P7). P4 would have liked reminders by a caregiver initially (after having the SCI) to build up the habit until he adopts the practice of PR by himself.</p><p>Demonstrating competence through collaborative tracking. Five participants (P1, P2, P5, P6, P7) expressed an interest in demonstrating their competence in performing PR-the sense that they are competent in performing the action-by tracking their PR performance collaboratively. For instance, P2 and P7 mentioned that engaging in collaborative tracking will create friendly competition, motivation, and profciency in PR practice: "when they have somebody that will hold them accountable and you know, whatever their particular health goal might be . . . that little bit of competition or somebody else encouraging you to do something, you're more likely to do it" (P2). Likewise, P1 wants to join his family in tracking activities: "I live with competitive people. And I've never been able to be a part of that. I mean, they're counting their steps and others; I can't do that. So the idea of somehow equating my doing efcient pressure reliefs with them taking steps. I'd be all over that" (P1). However, from the perspectives P2, P5, and P6, tracking PR with with non-disabled persons would not be helpful-as the motivation level (P5) and efort level (P6) will not be the same in performing PR in comparison to another activity. Additionally, P5 stressed that collaborative tracking would be more helpful in the early days after an SCI when people are new to this practice. P5, P6, and P7 all think collaborative tracking would have benefted them in the short-term period immediately after sustaining the SCI.</p><p>Thus, participants desire autonomy and authority to make decisions and maintain control, relatedness to be socially included and the ability to feel competence in their performance of PRs, and to be able to demonstrate that competence to others. A technological intervention for PR adherence should respect these preferences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head><p>These fndings illuminate both the complexity of the challenges and the exciting opportunities to develop better support for PR performance. We found that participants in this study do not currently use any reminder or tracking system to enhance PR practices despite being confdent that they are not meeting the recommendations, are afraid of encountering another PU, and are unsure of what action they could take to improve their PR adherence. Instead, we found that diferent understandings of how and when to perform PRs, forgetfulness, inconvenience, and awkward social scenarios lead them to each follow their own imperfect PR routines <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</p><p>More broadly, insights from this work can help to facilitate support for other high-frequency self-care behaviors for individuals with a severe SCI. For example respiratory self-care can involve: deep breathing exercises every four hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[55]</ref> and ventilator weaning every hour when transitioning to independent breathing <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">80]</ref>. Additional high-frequency self-management activities can include: catheterizing the bladder every 4-6 hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">52]</ref>, bowel management 30-45 minutes after a meal or hot drinks <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref>, and frequent activity for pain management to avoid spasticity or chronic pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref>. Although high-frequency is a continuum in this self-care context-some self-care activities need to be done every few hours (e.g., bowel and bladder management) and some must be done multiple times an hour (e.g., PR)-all of these self-care activities are crucial for this population to perform and need to be done multiple times in a day. Thus, similar challenges of inconvenience, and contextual factors might be applicable for these other high frequency self-care behaviors.</p><p>Participants would welcome support from technology to help them remember to do PRs when they forget or do them incorrectly in a private, ability-based, and context-aware way, and to facilitate a sense of their PR behavior such that they can be more confdent in knowing how far they are away from PR recommendations. Our fndings from this human-centric approach provide evidence that previous initiatives to improve PR adherence-constant reminder/feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[86]</ref>; feedback through mobile applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">74]</ref>; interface pressure mapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[84]</ref>; or electrical stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">45]</ref> -lack required of context, privacy, or specifc user abilities. These fndings can also be relevant for technology designed to support other high frequency self-care activities of this population. Such technology must be sensitive to the context and additional constraints these users face-including the specifc issues detailed herein of space, social stigmatization, and modality of or interaction.</p><p>Aspects of these fndings in the context of our severe SCI population are not directly transferable to individuals with less severe SCIs or manual wheelchair users because some of the insights depend on the mechanism for performing a PR (e.g. tilting a PWC) and the need for ability-based chairable interaction. However, even if the guidance does not transfer, the general concepts transfer well other user contexts and to other types of self-care behaviors. This section consolidates the fndings and discusses the takeaways as design implications to improve PR adherence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Participants wanted to increase their adherence but are in a tough spot</head><p>Adhering to PR performance is often framed as an issue of patient motivation-clinical personnel we have spoken to suggest that patients perhaps cannot be bothered to do PRs at the recommended frequency. However, our fndings for RQ1 paint a much more nuanced and complicated picture of the factors that contribute to the (non-)performance of PR and build on existing research for people with SCIs. First, we saw that participants in our study were aware of the need to perform PRs, and that their motivation was high--similar to the awareness of performing physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[56]</ref>.</p><p>Here the awareness to perform PR was driven by fear of sustaining another PU <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref>. Additionally, participants were using PWCs for diferent durations (2.5 to 18 years) and most of them had multiple PUs (one to fve) during these periods (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> in section 3.2). Although most participants initially learned about PR from their rehabilitation hospital, multiple instances of PUs made them more cautious and led them to do their own research and learn more about PR from potentially unreliable sources (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> in section 4.1.2). Thus, they developed their own perception of ideal PR behavior (frequency and duration) over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>. Further, the sheer number of PRs that they are expected to perform leave them with signifcant burden when integrated with their daily lives. Setting a timer would leave them with constant interruptions, even in situations when they had correctly performed their PR already. Without a timer, they are bound to forget PRs as they focus on the many other activities that fll their Beyond forgetting-which is the primary reason identifed in prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">39]</ref>-our participants' descriptions of performing PRs both inside and outside their homes communicate a massive psychological burden that they shoulder, one that inhibits their full participation in society and forces them to choose between taking care of their own bodies and conforming to a societal defnition of being socially appropriate. Participants prioritize being mindful of their PRs by constantly checking clocks, mixed with their own internal sense of the passage of time. This approach takes a lot of headspace for 30-50 PRs per day, and it is imperfect as it is too easy to become distracted or lose track of time (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref> in section 4.1.5).</p><p>Participants also sometimes skip doing a PR even though they remember that they should do one. One reason for is inconvenient timing. Additionally, most of the participants perform PR using the tilt-function of their PWC (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>), which is highly visible and requires additional space to perform. Thus, similar to physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[56]</ref>, participants avoid doing PRthis highly visible self-care activity-due to complex social norms and expectations. Sometimes, they opt for less obtrusive and less efective secondary manual methods PR-manual maneuvering on their seat if they able-but this is a compromise they make when they are in a difcult situation. In these cases, helpful solutions could consider creative ways of mitigating the barriers they face. While we unfortunately do not have solutions to all of these problems, communicating the perspectives these users is the essential frst step towards supporting them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Providing support depends on designing contextually-appropriate interactions</head><p>Our participants and the broader target population have a range of multiple disabilities and comorbidities resulting from severe SCIs. Moreover, the lack of accurate tracking and the absence of "quantifed past" <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> often make them uncertain about their previous PR performance. Our fndings for RQ2 indicate that technological interactions designed for any high-frequency self-care behavior of this population needs to fexibly accommodate the individuals' abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[85]</ref>, tracking needs, and contextual constraints.</p><p>First, smartphone notifcations will not be appropriate for many people in this population because their phones are inaccessible, and furthermore too many mobile notifcations will be burdensome, easily ignored, and are unlikely to be checked immediately <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[86]</ref>. As a result, while delivery through a mobile device can be a useful approach for some, for others a more convenient, familiar <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>, purpose-specifc modality-such as the armrest vibration conceptwill be a more efective mechanism for delivering a reminder. This echoes some of the thinking described in the "chairable" concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</p><p>Second, the contextual factors that combine to create inconvenient circumstances (discussed above and in section 4.1.5) could be recognized by technology. Reminders could be delivered more judiciously in circumstances where a user is likely to be encountering additional external barriers to performing a PR. Finally, for any future designs to be successful, they will need to account for the basic psychological needs of autonomy, relatedness, and competenceconsistent with self-determination theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[73]</ref>. We found evidence of the importance of these needs to our participants. Our fndings also highlight the psychological facts of routinization in self-care activities-improved personal agency, self-efcacy, and social interaction -that are similar to routinization of physical activity among manual wheelchair users reported by Mason et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[56]</ref>.</p><p>Overall, our participants expressed a desire to continue to engage in PR behaviors and welcome the support of appropriately-designed technology that supports their abilities, facilitates privacy, and considers diferent contexts to help them do so. One compelling idea is the concept of contextually-aware just-in-time <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[60]</ref> reminders that would be fexible enough to provide users dynamic control to re-routinize self-care behaviors and accommodate the constraints, contexts, and appropriate opportunities to act <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">46]</ref>. We envision that a future system could combine these insights to build a system that addresses the individual needs of PWC users in performing and monitoring PR. Elements of such a system might include:</p><p>• Automatic tracking to produce an record of self-tracked PR performance (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[81]</ref> for an example system) • The to manually track PR behaviors to capture relevant PR activity that cannot be easily captured through an automated system-e.g., leaning over, shifting weight, or adjusting cushions are all manual behaviors our participants described performing. Participants may also wish to manually track pain or use semi-automated tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> to capture these manual PR eforts. • The ability to specify basic parameters for the conditions under which they would want to receive a notifcation from the system, and what kind of notifcation they would want to receive. As examples, parameters could provide a maximum number of reminders per day, specify the amount of time since the previous PR that should elapse before a reminder is delivered, or specify contexts where reminders should or should not be delivered (e.g. don't deliver reminders while in transit but do provide a reminder after disembarking from a vehicle). Some users might only want the tracking features and may not want any notifcations or reminders at all. • A modular chairable interface that can be customized for the user according to individual functional ability and preference, and can support audio, visual, and/or haptic feedback at the location desired by the user. • The ability to review PR behavior data on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. This could reveal trends-such as an increase or decrease in PR adherence-as well as help to facilitate self-awareness of current behaviors. • The ability to share PR behavior with friends and family members. For example, perhaps a connection to a service such as Strava 2 could facilitate social connection on the performance of this important health behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">of personal informatics for supporting people with high-level SCIs</head><p>Our fndings demonstrate the potential for individuals with severe SCIs to beneft from personal informatics (PI) systems. In a recent review, et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> reviewed 523 papers from the PI literature where only four involved wheelchair users <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">54]</ref>. It is important to note that these included only manual wheelchair users except for one participant who used a PWC <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. Furthermore, none of those papers deployed PI systems to their participants, and only two among all participants from these studies reported using PI tools. All of these observations point to our primary fnding that individuals with wheelchairs are interested in the potential of PI (i.e. for tracking, monitoring etc.) to enhance their self-care behavior. However, the PI domain has not been explored adequately through an HCI lens for this population. Although Garmin and Apple have progressed by supporting tracking for manual wheelchair propulsion <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref>, those eforts still exclude PWC users. As PI aims to broaden its scope to accommodate diferent non-mainstream scenarios of people's lives through diferent domain-agnostic theories and models <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51]</ref>, people with severe motor disabilities deserve to beneft from personal informatics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">HCI research methods with individuals</head><p>with severe SCIs and comorbidities</p><p>Among our participants-all of whom had a severe SCI-four had multiple disabilities and comorbidities (P1, P4: with less hand functionality and upper-body impairments; P3, P4: speech difculties; P3: brain injury; P6: mild dementia). Due to the broader range of disabilities and multiple comorbidities of the target population, participation in research studies is often challenging for them; and thus these participants are often not included in HCI research <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">43]</ref>.</p><p>According to the recently published study methods guidelines for individuals with an SCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>, we combined a brief semi-structured interview and "needs-validation storyboard study" from the Speed Dating method to collect rich data from participants without the burden of real-time implementation of technological prototypes.</p><p>During the semi-structured interviews, we tweaked questions for the participants with speech difculties to make it easier for them to answer with fewer words. Later, during the storyboard study, when we showed them imaginary scenarios of possible futures, participants expressed their latent needs, perceptions, and current desires and fears <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> that helped us to clarify their brief answers from the interview phase. Notably, we needed to consider the entire transcript from a participant as a whole to infer some answers. We also attempted to email the participants with speech difculties (P3, P4) during our data analysis phase-three months after the interview session-to confrm our interpretation of their responses. Unfortunately, we did not receive any reply from them.</p><p>While this methodological adaptation failed, we believe this approach is an important adaptation in response to the recent call to adapt HCI methods to be more inclusive of participants with multiple disabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>. In the future, we would take additional steps to increase the likelihood of this strategy succeeding. We would analyze the data immediately after a study session with a participant with speech difculties. This way we could get back to the participant much sooner if any interpretations need to be confrmed or if there are gaps, increasing the likelihood they would respond. We would also tell them ahead of time that we may follow up, which could improve responsiveness. These continued eforts to be more inclusive in our HCI research methods are essential for producing and impactful research as a feld.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">LIMITATIONS</head><p>Our limited number of study participants refects the common challenge of recruiting participants with disabilities-often resulting in fewer participants than other typical HCI studies with non-disabled participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">50]</ref>. Additionally, individuals with a severe SCI need to follow numerous self-care activities, while our study was focused mainly on PR behavior. By conducting similar research for other high-frequency self-care activities, other concerns might be identifed that were not captured in this work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we investigated the high-frequency self-care behavior of PR among individuals with a severe SCI. Through a qualitative study, we highlighted current PR practices and provided design guidelines to support adherence. Our research shows that improvself-care adherence is not only about motivation or awareness, but also diferences in understanding what to do, remembering to do it at the right time and correctly, and dealing with contexts that can make those behaviors difcult to complete. These considerations point to the possibility that technology better support these behaviors through a carefully designed and contextually aware self-care reminder system that accounts for the many nuances of high-frequency self-care in a population of individuals with a severe SCI. Finally, we discuss our adaption of methods to accommodate participants with multiple disabilities, so that we could be more inclusive and collect rich data to represent the perspectives of these participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>. Although we cannot generalize our fndings to all self-care behaviors of individuals with a severe SCI, these design considerations can provide valuable guidance for HCI researchers to design for other complex, high-frequency self-care behaviors.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Scenario 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Vibration in the wheelchair armrestAfter finishing .....</figDesc></figure>
