<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper critically examines the impacts of social media-based business on urban residential architecture in Dhaka, Bangladesh and joins the growing body of work in critical HCI. Based on a seven-month-long qualitative empirical study in Dhaka, this paper reports how Facebook commerce (F-commerce) drives many local women to actively engage in home-based businesses, which in turn, challenges the inherent spatial regulations of modern residential architecture. This paper also documents how F-commerce mediated transformations in residential spaces are promoting heterogeneous functions, re-surfacing traditional values, and altering orders and rationales that define modern housing. Drawing from a rich body of literature in urban housing architecture, critical theories around modernism, South-Asian feminism, and postcolonial computing, we explain how these spatial transformations and alterations are "appropriating" architectural design vocabularies. Our findings further explain how negligence toward such emerging needs often marginalizes the women spatially and economically, who are involved in F-commerce. We conclude with design implications to architecture and HCI to address these issues, and connect our findings to the broader agendas of Postcolonial HCI around diversity, inclusion, and global development.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Bangladesh is experiencing a sudden escalation in E-commerce and social media-based online commercial activities with the rapid growth of ubiquitous computing and country-wide digitization initiatives like many other countries in the Global South <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">78]</ref> . Although E-commerce started in Bangladesh in the late 90's, the local e-commerce industry in Bangladesh began evolving as a proper ecosystem from 2012 <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">100]</ref>. The availability of cheap smart phones, affordable mobile data packages, and emergence of user-friendly and reliable mobile phone applications for transactions have skyrocketed the online businesses of various products and services in urban Bangladesh <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">89,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">97]</ref>. The immense popularity of Facebook among the young generation 1 has further augmented the prospect of such online businesses, and evolved this social media platform as one of the most effective means for advertising, auctioning, purchasing, and selling products and/or services using its ecosystems <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[79]</ref>. In other words, Facebook commerce (F-commerce) has become the most promising domain to expand business initiatives among the emerging urban entrepreneurs in Bangladesh <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">[192]</ref>. For the women entrepreneurs here, F-commerce is an even more powerful instrument and an emerging mechanism for empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[53]</ref>. F-commerce provides scopes to balance between family and professional lives as they can work from their homes, saves from commuter hassles and workplace harassment, and offers a cushion of social support as they expand their business ideas on Facebook leveraging their already existing social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[110]</ref>. These conveniences have fueled the immense women participation in F-commerce in the last couple of years. More than 60% of the present Bangladeshi F-commerce business entities are run by women entrepreneurs [4, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">110]</ref>, and most of them are working from their homes <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[110]</ref>. This particular spatial shift of a booming industry from urban commercial areas to homes, mediated through social media, has initiated transformations in the spatio-cultural practices in the lives of these women and their family members. While a dominant body of literature in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Information and Communication Technology and Development (ICTD), and related fields have focused on different aspects of digital marketplaces, e-commerce, and F-commerce <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">108]</ref>, very few studies have surfaced the political narratives that emerge when such global digital interventions meet local contextual conventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">117]</ref>. Hence, how F-commerce is impacting various household spatial and cultural dimensions there, has rarely appeared in HCI literature. In this paper, we address this gap by studying the emergence of F-commerce in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and report its multi-faceted impacts on the spatial, cultural, and social dimensions of modern housing in urban Dhaka.</p><p>Beyond HCI, the evolution and transformation of urban housing have long been at the center of academic discussions among anthropologists, economists, social scientists, philosophers, urban planners, and architects for their overarching impact on urban development in modern times <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[142,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">148,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">150,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">178]</ref>. The popular strands of work in these disciplines discuss essential urban issues around the housing sector. For instance, how different material and conceptual components of traditional housing have altered through the process of modernization <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr">155]</ref>, how formalization, privatization, and commodification of the housing sector, gentrification, and rent-gap generate political narratives on urban economic landscapes <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">182]</ref>, why there is a housing problem in the urban Global South <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[132]</ref>, and what role the informal housing sector is playing there <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[179]</ref>. These and similar crucial questions, pertinent to housing, try to map the trajectories of urban modernity and its impacts on societies. Recently, the contemporary literature in urban housing has started to focus on the impact of computing on the advanced and sustainable living quality, security and wellbeing of the dwellers, design and development of energy-efficient housing sectors, among others <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">153]</ref>. However, unlike many established veins of urban theory, this line of studies seldom addresses the complex urban contexts of the Global South and its post-colonial history of modernization. Hence, on the one hand, digital interventions developed in the Global North often fail to grasp the gravity of their impacts on urban spaces of the Global South, especially in housing. On the other hand, mainstream urban design and development sectors often overlook how urban spatial politics of this context interacts with the complex digital technologies (such as social media, F-commerce).</p><p>Our paper addresses this gap through a seven-month-long empirical study on modern housing in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and exploring a wide range of literature around critical urban theories, modernism, housing studies, architecture, and social sciences. Our empirical study includes interviews and focuses group discussions of homebased women F-commerce entrepreneurs and observation and documentation of their F-commerce activities in their apartments and on social media. Based on these interviews, online observations, and theoretical analysis, our paper makes a three-fold contribution to HCI scholarship. First, we present a detailed empirical account of F-commerce induced spatial transformations of Dhaka's modern housing/apartment complexes. Second, drawing from the critical urban and architectural theories around modernism, we provide the necessary theoretical lenses for Postcolonial HCI literature to comprehend the impacts of computing tools and techniques on the modernist conceptualization and materialization of housing design and development. Third, our paper explores essential design implications for architecture and HCI researchers to address some of the emerging concerns pertinent to this issue. This paper further discusses how our findings can help HCI and ICTD researchers to broaden their horizons toward sustainable, inclusive, and diverse research, design, and practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK 2.1 Urban Architecture and HCI</head><p>Our literature review opens at the intersection between Architecture and HCI. One of the most prominent veins of work in this area concentrates on designing and developing digital tools/ software to support the architects, planners, and constructors in designing, producing drawings, communicating with different stakeholders, and constructing the built environment. These tools often target toward automating the repetitive, mundane, and laborious tasks related to the designing and construction process of the built environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">76,</ref><ref type="bibr">159]</ref>. Moreover, they leverage the power of sophisticated mathematical modeling in design and help to attain intricate structural manifestations with precision and speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">139]</ref>. From Mitchell's work on computer-aided design <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[119]</ref> to Woodbury's principles for parametric design <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[187]</ref>, we have seen how computational advancement has shaped architectural design process, communication techniques, evaluation, and materialization <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">114]</ref>. Nowadays, the consecutive upgraded versions of BIM, AutoCAD, Rhino, ArchiCAD, Revit, ArcGIS, Grasshopper, SketchUp, Unity, Lumion, etc. are offering highly advanced support to the architects in survey analysis to design to communicate envisioned building spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">130,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">156,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">167]</ref>. Furthermore, to ensure sustainable, green, energy-efficient construction, and maintenance of built environment, simulation programs are being used at a global scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[48]</ref>. Data-driven Energy Modeling tools are being recommended for passive design, energy conservation, and energy-efficient design <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">136,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">161]</ref>. Such practices of using advanced data visualization and information and communication technologies help architects in envisioning a sustainable built environment with informed managements of accessible resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">135]</ref>.</p><p>A parallel strand of work (at the intersection between HCI and Architecture) concentrates on aiding the creativity of the designers, which often goes beyond the rationalization of contemporary architectural vocabularies. The work of Christopher Alexander <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[15]</ref>, Cedric Price <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[186]</ref>, Richard Saul Wurman <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">[189]</ref>, and Nicholas Negroponte <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[126]</ref> triggered computational interactivity within architectural systems. HCI works, based on their contribution, later allowed architects, planners, engineers, and designers to speculate spatial organizations, materials, spatial qualities, functional systems, and construction techniques in future-oriented ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[164]</ref>. The ongoing developments in computing technologies including smart materials, 3D printers, robotics, tangible interfaces, artificial intelligence, virtual and augmenting realities have triggered the architectural experimentation on interactive/ responsive systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[102,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">124,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">131,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">166]</ref>, participatory/ data-driven designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[29]</ref>, dynamic building apertures and envelops <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">109,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">185]</ref>, and media facades <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">58]</ref> among others. The recent conversations on Human-Building Interactions (HBI) have further broaden the scope of interdisciplinary work between HCI (artificial intelligence) and built environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[13]</ref>.</p><p>The literature at the intersection between Architecture and HCI also sheds light on the impact of computing over physical spaces of various scales. On the one hand, this domain talks about urban issues. From transportation to location-based online apps for foods-computing technologies ensure engagement of spaces, information, and people [49, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">157]</ref>. Urban events such as social movements, in recent times, also gain acceleration and scale-up in the "city squares" as social media intervenes. For instance, Mundt and her colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[123]</ref> explain how social media helped in coalition building, amplifying alternative narratives, and mobilizing participants during the Black Lives Matter movement. Similarly, Juris <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[93]</ref> demonstrates how public spaces of Boston city transformed into protest grounds during the #Occupy Everywhere movement after images of the protesters flooded social media. On the other hand, the domain of work mentioned above involves small-scale spatial narratives that react to the digital world. Manovich <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[113]</ref>, for instance, explains how "Instagramism" occupies, influences, and often alternates spatial experiences through photos posted on Instagram. In addition, the surveillance politics associated with smart building technologies and advanced security systems has also gained attention in critical avenues of HCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[121,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">134]</ref>. The ever-increasing dominance of 'online social' over the 'lived political' is generating conversations in several stands of HCI research (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr">101,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b171">176,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b184">190]</ref>, for example) Although the intersection between built environment and computing has become one of the most prominent avenues in HCI, it is mostly developed, defined, and discussed in the context of the Western World <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[117]</ref>. Built environments in the Global South are also responding toward digital advancement in their own way, which is still understudied. The limited pool of work mostly focuses on the urban issues of the Global South. For instance, Ahmed et al. investigate different forms of residual mobilities of the urban poor in Bangladesh and their dynamic involvements with the technical infrastructure of the city [9]. Jack et al. in their work on Phnom Penh, Cambodia, studied the "infrastructuring" of online marketplaces that embrace urban practical limits, cultural practices, and technological tools together <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[91]</ref>. On the contrary, Mim explains how secular operative models of digital marketplaces are limiting urban religious festivities in the non-secular contexts of the Global South <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[117]</ref>. The social media image culture is actively changing the narratives of spaces within the boundaries of a household in the Global South as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[118]</ref>. However, how commercial activities through social media or social commerce are impacting the spatial understanding in this context is still understudied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Modernism, Urban Housing, and the Global South</head><p>Next, we turn to the literature on modernism, urban housing, and related spatial politics of the Global South to articulate the contextual complexities that interact with emerging digital interventions and generate new narratives. The process of modernization in the nineteenth century initiated nation-wide transformations in the Western world, which included mass education, urbanization, industrialization, bureaucratization, and rapid communication and transportation <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[84]</ref>. The overall trajectories of economic (explained by Ward <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[144]</ref>) and political modernization (explained by Huntington <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[83]</ref>) shaped the necessities of a "modern" life. For instance, intensive application of technology and high specialization of labour gave birth to a massive industrial sector with a consistent demand for labour, supplied from rural areas. Hence, on the one hand, a new urban working class emerged, who needed "affordable" accommodations in the urban areas to work in the factories <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[84]</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, the political modernization engendered the concept of a single, secular, national authority, and detached the new urban working class from its previous familial, ethnic, religious authoritative connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[83]</ref>. Therefore, the functional demands associated with modern accommodations or housing got rid of extended (kinship-based) social connections and cultural performances <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[105]</ref>. Such transformation of housing from a cultural entity (traditional) to a modern commodity helped modernist urban planners to define, design, and develop 'monocultural' housing areas (separate from work, business, recreation, and administrative areas) for the urban working class to support industrial progress <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[92]</ref>. In architectural terms, modern housing conforms to open floor plan, significance on functional rationality, clean geometric structure and built form that represent the functional organizations, provision of abundant light and air, and use of modern building materials and construction techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr">155]</ref>. Although many modernist thought processes around urban housing have been harshly criticized for their Utopian visions (distant from reality) in the western world <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">133,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">140]</ref>, modern architectural features and design methods received attention in the postcolonial countries of the Global South <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">149]</ref>. After independence, these countries adopted modernist development models to accelerate economic (rapid industrialization) <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[144]</ref>, political (nation-building) <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[144]</ref>, social (the rational man) <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[84]</ref>, and spatial (rank, size distribution of the cities) development processes. This led toward a significant adoption and application of modern building materials, techniques, design methods, planning strategies, and aesthetics in the built environment of these contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">149,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">160]</ref>. The urban housing sector, in particular, went through massive transformations. From space use, layout, and production of dwellings to "efficient" planning strategies for denser housing areas with essential urban utilities-modernist approaches replaced many traditional aspects of the built environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[19]</ref>. However, the transformation of housing from traditional to modern, in many parts of the Global South, did not happen overnight. Instead, it has been a slow process. An "intermediate continuum" of built forms has been/ is being generated in this process of transformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[104]</ref>. For example, Larsson explains how, in Botswana, a house can be modern in terms of material but traditional in terms of layout <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[104,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">105]</ref>. In a similar spirit, many renowned modern architects from the Global South (inter alia, Charles Correa, Laurie Baker, Mazharul Islam, Bashirul Haq, Geoffrey Bawa) appropriated and re-appropriated western modernist design vocabularies with the traditional ones. However, in most cases, the urge to be associated with the modern western world often forced people to perceive "modern-looking" houses (exterior and interior) as an effective means of portraying development <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[105,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">118]</ref>. Hence, the "popularity" of modern housing in the Global South has generated essential domains of scholarship in various disciplines. The complexities of land use, land tenure, and involvement of the public and private sector in formalizing, upgrading, and reassessing housing sectors in this context have received attention in urban planning theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">26,</ref><ref type="bibr">183]</ref>. Similarly, veins in urban design studies and urban economics explore the privatization and commodification of housing and their impacts on the political economy of dwelling culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[137,</ref><ref type="bibr">188]</ref>. Recent studies on advanced building materials and construction processes shed light on the importance of environmental and economic sustainability of urban housing scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">112,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">154]</ref>. In parallel, many scholars have demonstrated ways of integrating traditional building materials in modern construction systems to reduce carbon footprint <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">120]</ref>. Exploration of various passive design strategies have further enhanced the possibility of building more energy-efficient modern dwelling systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[138,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">180]</ref>. Health sectors, on the other hand, advocate for housing conditions developed by modernist approaches to ensure a healthy living environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[56]</ref>. For instance, according to WHO, reduction in the household crowd, thermal comfort, effective plumbing systems, improved light and air quality, etc. are essential for a healthy living environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[128]</ref>. These and similar stands of work around urban housing demonstrate many successful and failed aspects of modern housing systems in the context of the Global South. However, it has not been explored yet how the massive digitization, the rapid increase of social media users, and digital marketplaces are actively impacting the modernist housing systems here. Our paper responds to this gap and informs HCI about the impact of technologies on built environments of the Global South.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">E-commerce, Social Media, and Gender-based Spatial Politics</head><p>The sudden escalation in E-commerce in the last few decades has brought changes in the conventional forms of economic activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">181]</ref>. Transformation of an existing business (whole/ partial) into a digital one or initiating new business models at any scale in the digital world <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[82]</ref>-E-commerce activities are demanding new skillsets for both sellers and buyers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[14]</ref>. These skillsets range from pursuing customers on a digital platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[99]</ref> to transactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">[146]</ref> to "infrastructuring" the supply/delivery at a local or global scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[91]</ref>. The design and development of online marketplaces, hence, concentrate on upgrading digital tools to ensure dynamic, effective, fast yet smooth business operations. Large-scale image recognition and classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[173]</ref>, image or text-based search engines, systematic collaborations among several digital marketplaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[184]</ref>, advanced and more inclusive recommendation systems to ensure fairness, relevance, and satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[116]</ref>, and many more interventions are making digital marketplaces more user-friendly mostly for the demand side (consumers). Similarly, many interdisciplinary research veins predominantly concentrate on consumers to understand, assess, and respond to the emerging market economy. For instance, consumer behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">165]</ref>, perceptions <ref type="bibr">[40]</ref>, satisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[127]</ref>, trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[70]</ref>, among others, have received immense attention research-wise. However, the supply or seller side largely remained understudied for a long time <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[175]</ref>.</p><p>In recent years, the supply side of digital marketplaces have started to get attention as two-sided marketplace platforms (such as Uber, Lyft, AirBnb, etc.) emerged <ref type="bibr">[115]</ref>. Both demand (users/consumers) and supply (hosts or drivers) sides become spatiotemporally active in two-sided marketplaces, which involve interaction among multiple stakeholders <ref type="bibr">[115]</ref>. Such complex modalities of digital marketplaces achieve a more "societal" dimension, as social media commerce (social commerce in other terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[31]</ref>) intervenes. Already established features on social media (e.g., Facebook Like, Comment, Share, Live options) provide an opportunity for different business entities to communicate with the customers in a more interactive way <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[33]</ref> than the conventional e-commerce. Either through individual "pages" or more developed platforms to buy, sell, and exchange various items on social media (e.g., Facebook Marketplace)-entrepreneurs, vendors, companies of different scales are leveraging their social media enhanced networks for commercial activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">62]</ref>. Besides the already established business entities, small-scale entrepreneurial approaches are finding social media as a much easier "entry point" toward digital economy (see examples <ref type="bibr">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">107,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b167">172]</ref>). Therefore, social commerce is becoming popular in many parts of the world and appearing as a new area of study for both academia and industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">[193]</ref>. However, similar to e-commerce studies, the majority of this investigation concentrates on consumers through two interrelated topics: (a) user/consumer behaviours and (b) social media features' design for better operations of social commerce <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[33]</ref>. Such concentrations sideline the contexts, strategies, perceptions, and business models of the sellers (active on social media), and we hardly get the actual image of how social commerce operates.</p><p>Recently, scholars have started to shed light on the "supply" side of the social commerce. Moser and her colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[122]</ref>, through their study on closed Mom-to-Mom Facebook sale groups, explain how the members leverage their online groups' operating structure (admin, membership, regulations, and shared identity) to promote sell, buy, or exchange. They argue that even though these groups experience a lack of advanced e-commerce tools (e.g., search engine, payment system, fraud detection, conflict resolution), the trust mechanism among the sellers and the buyers in a communitylike closed group help running their businesses. Jack and her colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[91]</ref> expand the actions of the sellers to an infrastructural level and report how in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, sellers (active on Facebook) embed their "long-standing cultural practices" in selling, transacting, and delivering procedures. On contrary, Mim <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[117]</ref> focuses on the limited digital literacy of the rural cattle-sellers in Bangladesh, who try to sell their cattle on Facebook during Eid ul Adha (Feast of Sacrifice for Muslim communities). She reports the emergence of "digital middlemen" and how they help the rural farmers to sell their cattle to the city people via Facebook groups. While these studies point to various contextual barriers that the sellers face on social commerce (especially on F-commerce), very few studies have been done on the struggles of women entrepreneurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[33]</ref> in this new form of business. How women F-commerce entrepreneurs engage, respond, and react to various spatial politics within their operational domain-remains largely understudied. Our paper, situated in an urban setting of Bangladesh, essentially surfaces this issue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">MODERN HOUSING AND CONTEMPORARY DHAKA</head><p>Starting from a small settlement on the bank of Buriganga, Dhaka has become the 11th largest mega-city in the world <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. The urban agglomeration of Dhaka in the last 50 years has dramatically impacted the housing sector. Housing had transcendentally been a private segment action, restricted inside Old Dhaka <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[90]</ref>. Public housing in Dhaka, in the colonial period, had mainly been limited to constructing Bungalows for the high-ranking government officials <ref type="bibr">[63]</ref>. The European architectural plan of housing for the "first-class" citizens got to be fashionable within the nineteenth century <ref type="bibr">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">8]</ref>. Within the Pakistan period (1947-71), modern structures were built for housing the upper-class people within the public and private sectors <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Expansive tracts of lands were procured by government bodies and created as arranged residential areas <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. With the rise of rapid urbanization, ever-increasing urban migration and industrial expansion, Dhaka has been experiencing a population boom from the 80s, which subsequently increases housing demand within the city <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">95]</ref>. This emerging demand for modern private housing has helped the real estate business to flourish in Dhaka in the last few decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">103]</ref>. Due to limitations in horizontal expansion, a vertical expansion of the city has taken place to accommodate the growing population <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[163,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">171]</ref>. Modern apartment housing, as a phenomenon, was first introduced by the formal private developers in the early 80s to the housing history of Dhaka and has evolved from mid-rise to high rise ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">95,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">103]</ref>. Apartment housing first appeared in Dhaka near Central Road and subsequently spread to other residential areas, including Paribagh, Maghbazar, Siddeshwari, Shantinagar, Dhanmondi, Mirpur, Banani, old DOHS, new DOHS, Gulshan and Baridhara, to name just a few <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[47]</ref>. There are a few typologies of apartment buildings in Dhaka. Based on the apartment ownership model, there are two groups-the first group consists of buildings with individual owners, where apartment units are put on rent separately by the same owner. Families, who cannot afford to buy apartments by themselves, live as tenants in these kind of buildings. The second group of buildings are built by developers, and apartments are sold to separate individuals/families <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[118]</ref>. For every apartment building in the second group, the communal aspects are dealt by an elected managing committee of the owners. Based on vertical expansion, apartment buildings of Dhaka can be of two types-a) ground floor parking+ five-storied walk-up buildings and b) 7-20 storied high rise ones. Individual homes of the rich have taken the form of single-storey bungalow type to two-story duplex and even three-storey triplex type. However, the numbers of such houses are minimal. House rent in Dhaka increased by 250 percent between 1990 and 2007 <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[47]</ref>. Floor spaces range from under 300 square feet for low-priced units to over 3000 square feet for luxury units <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Minimal public housing opportunities forced the city dwellers to largely depend on the formal and informal private sectors for their housing solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[96]</ref>. In the absence of well-established formal land and housing markets in Dhaka, the informal sectors have been playing a significant role in catering to the housing needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[96]</ref>. Small-scale builders and developers and (self-help) owners-builders operating in the informal private sector are the largest suppliers of land and shelters in Dhaka <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[88]</ref>. In this paper, we will concentrate on the formal, private sector of housing, which includes mid to high rise apartment buildings, owned or rented by single families 2 . Since the demand and cost of space in Dhaka are increasing enormously, the city's housing market is gradually going beyond the reach of the middle and lower-middle-income urban population <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[96]</ref>. Most of the middle-income families live in rented apartments in multifamily apartment buildings. Upper-middle-income families either live in rented apartments or owned apartments.</p><p>The basic architectural features of these housing units or complexes follow the vocabularies of modern housing architecture (that prioritizes minimalism and functionalism). Spatial arrangements, building materials, and construction techniques of the residential buildings in a housing complex or individual apartment buildings adhere to modern zoning, circulation, functional, and aesthetic demands. Each Dwelling unit/ apartment is usually comprised of 1-4 bedrooms, 1-3 bathrooms, one living space, one dining space, one kitchen, and 1-3 verandas. In most cases, the floor-plan layouts of these apartments clearly show function and privacy-based spatial arrangements. For instance, the "public" zone, including the living room, guest bedroom (if any), and the shared bathroom, is usually located near an apartment's main entrance, while the bedrooms/ private zones are located at the far end. As semi-private/ transitional zones, the kitchen and dining space are usually located in-between the "public" and private zones in a floor-plan layout. Our participants confirmed that before starting their F-commerce activities they followed this function-oriented spatial arrangements of their modern apartments. All three zones served their household functional requirements. Like our participants' apartments, these zoning system establish visual and spatial connections with the surrounding environment in most cases. For instance, Dhaka's residential buildings are naturally ventilated. Hence, kitchens and bathrooms always have windows to ensure natural airflow. Verandas develop visual connections with the surrounding neighbourhoods. They are mostly used to sun clothes after washing. The elevations of these buildings (being populated with kitchen and bathroom windows and verandas) reflect the residential function-oriented spatial arrangements of the apartments, which are different from that of commercial buildings, offices, restaurants, or banks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">METHODS</head><p>We conducted a seven-month-long qualitative empirical study in Dhaka, Bangladesh, from mid-January to August 2021. Our team consists of four Bangladeshi women, born and raised in Bangladesh. They are academically trained architects, experienced in designing residential buildings in Dhaka, and experts in critical social science research. Our study was conducted amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and due to government-imposed restrictions, the study was entirely online. Our study had seven major phases: (a) online study of Facebook groups and pages that are involved in F-Commerce activities at a local level, (b) typology analysis of these pages, grouping, and sorting, (c) reaching out to the page owners and short-listing participants for interview, (d) online interviews and FGDs (Focus Group Discussions) with the participants, (e) virtual tour to their home-based working spaces, (f) Online interviews with women architects, (g) analysis of collected data. We describe each phase of our methods in detail in the following paragraphs.</p><p>First, we focused on finding public Facebook Groups that work as a platform to promote local F-Commerce entrepreneurs. Initially, we used Facebook search tools and keywords (Bangladesh, Facebook, marketplace, Dhaka, online, bazaar, bazar, F-commerce, BD, DHK, buy, sell, forum, market, business, women, entrepreneur, home-based, etc.) to find such groups. These searches revealed 453 results. We excluded those Bangladeshi groups, which are not operating in Bangladesh (dedicated for Bangladeshi migrants in different countries), or private groups, or not open to all kinds of products, or do not allow women members, or work as marketplaces (not as a platform to promote the entrepreneurs), or not active/ do not have at least five new posts in a day, or do not have at least 10 thousand members. We ended up with six public groups: Women and e-Commerce forum ( WE ), Buy &amp; Sell Business Community BD, Kena-Becha Buy-Sell Bangladesh, Sell Bazar of Bangladesh, Online Shopping, and Online Market Place. These groups work as a platform for the entrepreneurs to attain visibility among a large customer base in the digital world. Page owners/entrepreneurs share the Facebook Page links of their businesses in these groups (if any). In a post on a group's wall, they add a brief introduction of themselves, a few sentences to describe their business ventures, and images of the products they are selling. We followed these public groups, read the posts daily, and generated a data sheet where we listed and grouped the entrepreneurial pages based on the products they were selling (such as food items, clothing, jewellery, home decor items, utensils, imported devices, etc.). To limit our study within the boundary of Dhaka, we only listed those pages, who operated as Dhaka-based entities. We also noted page links, the name and gender of the person posting on the groups' walls, items they sell, and if they are home-based or not. We kept analyzing these public groups on Facebook until our study reached a theoretical saturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[129]</ref>. After 1.5 months, we ended up listing 256 home-based entrepreneurs, who operated their separate pages and were active in Dhaka.</p><p>In the second phase of our study, we analyzed these 256 pages and found that 187 of them are operated by women and are homebased. We reached out to the admins of those pages via Facebook Messenger and invited them to participate in our study. In that invitation, we added a brief introduction of ourselves and our project to have their attention. Only 98 of them initially showed interest in our study. We scheduled a 10 min call with each of them to describe our project and research methods. 45 of them declined to participate in the study due to time conflict, workload, and other personal reasons. Among the rest 53, five participants did not live in an apartment building/ housing complex and hence, were disqualified. We ended up having 48 participants for our study.</p><p>We interviewed our 48 participants in the next phase. All our 48 participants were women, between 21-52 yrs old. Among them, 21 were undergraduate/graduate students, 11 were home-makers, 9 were jobholders, and seven were looking for jobs after graduation. We allowed them all to visit our Facebook profiles and websites to gain their trust. We conducted semi-structured interviews with them over Facebook Messenger, Zoom, Viber, and/or WhatsApp (chosen according to the convenience of the participants). In the interviews, besides basic demographic information, we asked about their ideas behind their business, initial investment, profit model, workload, vendors or supply process of "raw materials", platforms they use to enlarge their customer base. We also asked about the description of their apartments (rental/owned, area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, zoning, changes they made to accommodate their business), description of their apartment building/ housing complex, adversities they faced online and offline, helping hands, and involvement of family members. The interviews were 1 hour 15 minutes long on average. After the interview, each of the participants was asked if they were interested in participating at FGDs, and/or allowing us to virtually visit their apartments via a video call over their preferred communication platform. Twelve agreed to participate in the FGDs, and 16 (with whom we had mutual friends on Facebook) allowed virtual tours to their apartments. All 48 of them were requested to send photos of the spaces in their apartment they used for F-commerce activities. We received photos from 27 of our 48 participants. Through this phase, we received information about apartment housings located in 14 different neighbourhoods in Dhaka city, including Banasree, Rampura, Muhammadpur, Jatrabari, Badda, Moghbazar, Mirpur, Bailey Road, Indira Road, Bashundhara Residential Area, Savar, Uttara, Pallabi, and Shantinagar.</p><p>Next, we conducted 3 FGDs with 4 participants in each group. We used the Facebook Messenger Group Call tool for our FGDs to ensure everyone's convenience. The objective of these FGDs was to understand the common challenges, strategies, thoughts around the present and future modifications of their apartments. We also asked them to individually speculate, draw, and share the apartments they wished in the future that would support their business ventures. The FGDs were an hour-long on average.</p><p>Virtual tours to the apartments of our 16 (out of 48) participants were scheduled according to their convenience, workload, and timetable. Tours were 15-minute long on average. During our tour, we did not ask for the exact location or address of their apartment. We requested our participants to start the tour from the main entrance to their apartments and show us the apartment rooms afterwards. We observed and took notes on the spatial organization, zoning, circulation, and F-commerce activity spaces of each apartment. We also took notes on the apartment's orientation, windows and veranda locations, and inventories associated with their business.</p><p>Next, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 professional women architects and interior designers, who had at least three years of experience in designing apartments in Dhaka. The participants were selected through a snowball sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[68]</ref>. We started with four Architects, whom we knew from our social network. We then expanded the participation pool using the social network of our existing participants. When our study reached a theoretical saturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[129]</ref>, we wrapped up since additional interviews started adding a negligible amount of new information. The interviews were online, 45 minutes long on average, and conducted over Facebook Messenger, Viber, Zoom, or WhatsApp (chosen by the participants). The participants discussed the limitations of modern apartments and how their women clients often struggle to fit in their spatial preferences in those apartments. They also informed us about the struggle of women architects in establishing their voice in the design process of residential apartment buildings or housing complexes.</p><p>In total, our study produced 61 semi-structured interviews, 3 FGDs, 360 hours of online observation, more than 252 pages of notes, more than 100 photographs, 48 apartment floor plans (roughly drawn) with spatial information mapped on them, 12 speculative floor plan of future apartments, and more than 480 hours of online conversations. Participation in our study was completely voluntary and unpaid (according to the culture of Bangladesh, it is considered awkward to offer money to someone for such 'talking'). However, as a gesture of courtesy, we 'liked' and shared the pages of our entrepreneur participants, and bought products from there. The interviews and FGDs were all conducted in Bangla. The interviews were audio-recorded with the permission of the participants. We transferred the audio recordings to a secured computer. Our researchers wrote down the descriptions of the apartment unit, apartment building/ housing complex (if shared by the participants), and spatial usages in their notebooks during the virtual tours. All the interviews were transcribed and translated by the members of this research team, who are fluent speakers of Bangla and English.</p><p>We started analyzing the anonymized qualitative data (that we collected throughout our empirical work) by following the inductive approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[174]</ref>. All four authors were engaged in carefully reading the interview and FGD transcripts. Each of the transcripts was read at least four times to discard irrelevant parts of the interviews/ FGDs and highlight the portions that responded to our research questions. We had weekly discussions (virtual) on the discarded materials to avoid omitting any critical excerpts. Later these relevant, anonymized data (interviews, notes, and FGDs) were analyzed using open coding <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[168]</ref> and thematic analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[27]</ref>. Here we should mention that we did not have any predetermined themes in our minds to ensure openness to any emerging themes. We clustered data based on patterns and then combined the patterns to generate themes of our findings. Our team met (virtually) twice a week to analyze the highlighted and non-highlighted excerpts to evaluate the themes, their contextual accuracy, and appropriateness around the research questions. All four research team members thoroughly analyzed the codes and themes in several rounds and developed the final themes presented in the next section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">FINDINGS</head><p>Our data reveal a wide variety of ways how various modern design aspects of Dhaka's apartments that we studied are actively impacting online business involvements of the women on Facebook. To better articulate the findings, we group them into five important aspects of modern housing design in Dhaka: homogeneity, order, rationale, repetition, and detachment. In the subsections below, we present the impacts of each of them on F-commerce.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Homogeneity</head><p>In early 20th century, the urban modernity project initiated a program-based separation in the built environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[179]</ref>. The modernist urban planners emphasized on strict segregation of visual and functional orders of urban "buildings" to ensure rational, efficient, and "fast" operations of these buildings and infrastructures <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[151]</ref>. Such planning method generated different zones of urban activities: residential housing zone, commercial zone, office zone, entertainment zone, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[151]</ref>. While such clearly separate homogeneous zoning was achievable in most parts of the Western world, situation in the Global South countries like Bangladesh, was much different. In Dhaka, for example, the older parts of the city experienced modernization as the palimpsests of traditional and modern urban and architectural designs. Here we can find mixed-use/heterogeneous, concentrated urban functions: shops at the lower levels of a residential building, kitchen markets embedded in the residential neighborhoods, small boutique shop/ tailor on the roof of a mosque, etc. However, the newer parts of the city demonstrates a strong influence of homogeneous modern urban planning and design. Residential areas are defined and separated from that of commercial or office areas. Gated housing areas have gradually become a symbol of upper-class living <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[125]</ref>. Eventually, the middle-income urban population became interested in living either in residential areas that show homogeneous nature in urban zoning, or in the buildings that were fully residential. At present, a significant portion of the city embraces modern notion of separating housing from business/work space, in other words, conforming to spatial homogeneity. Our participants mentioned that such modern spatial homogeneity is developing layers of constraints for their online businesses. The following two cases explain this phenomenon.</p><p>Case 1: Sanjana (pseudo name, 27 yrs old, freelance architect) lives with her parents in a reputed residential area. Since 2017 she has been running a Facebook page that sells Indian and Pakistani apparel and accessories. Her interest in fusion-fashion motivated her to start her own business at her home using Facebook as a reliable platform to get customers. With an investment of 20000 BDT (approx. 235 USD), she started her business. She earns 10000-15000 BDT (approx 117-176 USD) from her page monthly. Along with her primary profession as a freelance architect, she greatly enjoys this apparel and accessories business on Facebook. She spends 4-6 hours on her business every day, which involves photo shooting of her products that she collects from local wholesale markets, composing Facebook posts for these products on her page, communicating with potential customers on Facebook Messenger, sorting and packaging orders placed on Messenger, re-arranging inventory, and contacting to local delivery services to collect the packaged products from her apartment. Although these activities consume much space in her apartment and hamper her regular life, she prefers this model of 'earning from home. ' However, her relatives and neighbours do not consider her business a "work" since she runs it from her apartment. She says, "I earn enough from my Facebook page to support my pocket money. I am planning to expand this business as well. However, people will not consider this mode of business as " work" until I open an office or an outlet in a commercial area/ building. One of my relatives asked me if I could not land a job in a big office building. I receive questions every day like-how long am I going to stay at home? What was the purpose of my degree if I won't work in an office?. According to them, this hurts my family's reputation. Somehow people do not consider any work as "work" if done from your home, which is highly demoralizing while running a business. " -Sanjana (Pseudo name, 27 yrs old) Sanjana's case points toward the modern notion of spatial homogeneity that ensures separate housing and workplaces, not only in the built environment but also in the mindsets of "modern" people. F-commerce has started to question the rationale behind such a notion. COVID -19 WFH culture has further strengthened the questions around spatial homogenization. However, that discussion is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>Case 2: Mrs. Hossain (pseudo name, 50 yrs old, home-maker) and her daughter run a catering business from their home through their Facebook page. They live in an apartment building in a renowned residential area in the northern part of Dhaka city. Mrs. Hossain is a great cook and loves to see her page gaining popularity. Her daughter helps her with cooking. She takes photos/videos of the cooked items (for Facebook posts), responds to their customers' queries on their page, and arranges delivery man. Mrs. Hossain concentrates on cooking, packaging, and receiving payments. They have not faced any problems from their neighbours. However, they were in difficulty at the beginning of their business due to living in a large residential area. Mrs. Hossain says, "We came to learn about a digital platform called "Foodpeon". Through location-based app services, Foodpeon receives orders for homemade food items and offers delivery services as well. Once they receive an order, Foodpeon passes it to the local chefs/caterers like us. After a certain time (allocated for preparation), the delivery man from Foodpeon comes to pick up the food from the local chefs for delivery. They have a dedicated Facebook page to promote the chefs as well. This digital platform caught my attention a year ago, and we got registered with them. A few days later, Foodpeon sent their investigators to visit our kitchen to check hygiene levels. We got enlisted as Foodpeon caterers and started preparing food for the orders they received. After some time, we discovered that we are not getting enough orders to prepare compared to other caterers from surrounding localities with commercial and office buildings. Since we live in a purely residential area, unlike the commercial/office areas, there is not much demand for homemade foods for lunch or snack times. Hence we signed off from this location-based service and started our own Facebook page, where people from any area place an order by contacting my daughter. However, we are spending more money for delivering the foods at distant locations" -Mrs. Hossain (pseudo name), 50 yrs old, Home-maker.</p><p>Mrs. Hossain and her daughter believe that if they could live in the older parts of the city with mixed-use urban texture, their business would have been more profitable. Those parts of the city are the best for getting customers and kitchen supplies with minimum transportation cost. Suddenly they have started to see the spatial limitations of their modern housing complex.</p><p>These and many other stories from our participants demonstrate how F-commerce has started to point toward the legibility of spatial homogenization as a product of modernism in both conceptual and material terms. Our participants advocated for more flexible spatial arrangements within their built environment, which is more aligned with the traditional forms of spatial arrangements. Such advocacy necessitates taming down the ongoing modernization projects in the city and its hinterlands and developing a new framework for future urban land-use planning considering the emerging demand of F-commerce mediated spatial heterogeneity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Order</head><p>The process of modernization concentrates on ordering or "categorizing" the urban surroundings in an "official" manner, which is quite different from the "vernacular" order of a particular locality <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[151]</ref>. For instance, in the mixed-used, more traditional urban areas in Dhaka, the location of a residential building might be known by a family, or a local tea stall nearby, or a local mom-andpop shop. Hence, in vernacular order, it is important to know the local geography. Local stories, incidents, features, and many cultural attributes are encoded in such order. The newer parts of the city, on the other hand, surface a systematic, rational, and "easy to navigate by outsiders" order implemented by the planners. A residence in such modern areas can be located by the street number, block number, building number, and apartment number. Such an order does not rely on local stories to operate. Nonetheless, with the emergence of F-commerce, a new order is being developed within the boundaries of the "officially ordered" modern housings. New "local" stories, generated on social media, overlap with the modern official order and develop a new hybrid order. The following case explains this scenario.</p><p>Case 3: Keya (pseudo name, 21 yrs old, Undergrad student) lives with her parents in a housing complex near central Dhaka. They have been living in this housing complex for the last 12 years. This gated housing complex has six fully residential 8-storied buildings with parking lots on the ground floors and basements. Each of the buildings of this residential complex has a building number. Each of these 8 storied buildings accommodates 4 apartment units on each floor. Most of these apartments are owned by individual owners. Keya and her family live in building number 2. For the last 1.5 years, Keya has been running a catering business from her kitchen. She has a very popular Facebook page, where she posts photos of her cooked dishes daily. She shared her Facebook page on different Facebook public groups, including her high-school alumni group, several girls' networks, and entrepreneur supporting groups to attract more customers to buy healthy food items from her. Every day she receives 20-25 orders for lunch or snacks from people, who contact her through her page. In the beginning, she faced some objections from her neighbours about running a business from her apartment. To limit outsiders coming to the complex to collect foods from her, she has hired a personal delivery man, a distant relative of her family. Now, the neighbors do not have much complaints. Her apartment is more known by the name of her Facebook page than the number of the building, the floor, and the apartment. She says, " Each of the buildings of my housing complex has 28 apartments. So the housing complex has 168 apartments. There are 168 families with number plates hanging in front of their apartment front door. The developer company, who designed and built this complex, did this numbering of the buildings and apartments. In the last 12 years, I got to know only a few families from this complex. In most of the cases, the kids of these families went to the same school as me. They are my Facebook friends as well. Once I opened my catering page, I shared it with them. During one Ramadan (the month of fasting for Muslims), one of them told me that she visited my page and wanted to order Firni (a local dessert item) for her family for the Iftar (meal taken by the Muslims after day-long fasting). She liked my Firni so much that she started recommending my Facebook page to the other families of our housing. During that Ramadan, I delivered Iftar items to 108 apartments of our housing complex from my page. Now everyone in the complex knows me, knows where I live in this apartment jungle. My apartment number became overshadowed by the name of my page. Even people started locating their apartments centring mine. For instance, Mrs. Nilufar, who lives one floor above us, nowadays describes the location of her apartment to others by referring to my page... like.. she lives on the next floor of Keya's Dine (pseudo name for her Facebook page). That is more memorable to others than the boring building number, floor number, and apartment number. " (pseudo name), 21 yrs old, Student story indicates two aspects of modern orders that are being challenged by her F-commerce activities. First, the modern ordering system of arranging and marking the location of a apartment generalizes all apartments as ordinary dwelling units and hence, conceals many socio-cultural values that a dwelling unit produce and re-produce. Keya's F-commerce activities helped her to go beyond such numeric generalization of her apartment and enhanced her social bonding with her neighbours during Ramadan through her Page. Second, the modern ordering system provides minimal scope to generate narrative-based "local geography". Howwith the emergence of F-commerce, new stories, features, and are creating a new, hybrid version of "local geography", which is not limited to the physical world anymore.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rationale</head><p>we have discussed before, the transformation from agricultural to urban industrial societies under "capitalist impulses" engendered modern housing in different parts of the world in the century <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">141]</ref>, which endorsed a systematic structure or arrangement that conforms to the programmatic needs of modern society. To accommodate large migrated populations in limited urban spaces, modernist architects and urban planners needed to develop scientifically rational design solutions. A systemic plumbing system, efficient circulations, proper ventilation, provision of natural light, rapid and low-cost construction, low-cost maintenance, and thermal comfort transformed a housing unit -from a cultural entity to a more scientific one. From the floor plan design of a dwelling unit to a site plan development of a large housing (a clustered form of tens or hundreds of dwelling units)we can trace such scientifically rational design decisions. For inin a modern dwelling unit, we can find a program-specific distribution of spaces-bedrooms to sleep (located far from the entrance), living space for family and guests (near the entrance), straight-forward circulations directly connect most active spaces like kitchen and dining. Location of bathrooms ensures less complicated plumbing systems. The minimal approach of space allocation eliminates any space that cannot be assigned to the basic functions (relaxing, cooking, eating) of a "modern man" after their work.</p><p>temporal usages of spaces in a unit determine the logilocations of the rooms in a modernist method of design. Such spatio-temporal rational aspects of a modern dwelling unit are being challenged as the home-based F-commerce activities start to boom in urban Dhaka. The following cases shed light on this Case 4: Like most of the two-bedroom apartments in Dhaka, Parijaat's (Pseudo name, 21 yrs old, Undergrad Student) apartment has two bathrooms, one kitchen, one living cum dining space, and one verandah. The planning layout conforms to the privacy-based zoning of spaces. Public spaces (living, dining) are located near the entrance to the apartment, while semi-public and private spaces kitchen, veranda) are far from it. Parijaat and her family been living in this rental apartment for more than five years She and her younger sister (high school student) share one (with a small veranda), her parents (working professionsleep in another. They have arranged their furniture according the floor-plan layout of the apartment. They have been using the spaces according to the spatial arrangement suggested by the plan. However, things started to change once Parijaat started her home-based F-commerce of macrame home decor. She prepares decorative items such as wall mats, partitions, balcony swings, mirror frames, photo frames, plant-pot hangers, poufs, and baby hammocks. From her trendy Facebook page, she sells these handmade macrame items. Her business has started to transform the daily pattern of usage of the spaces of their apartment. She says, "This apartment was not designed to accommodate a business. Hence, I had to re-purpose the rooms. The whole process requires much space, actually. I stack the raw materials (cotton ropes) underneath my bed, my parents' bed, even sometimes in any spare corner of the kitchen if needed. I use my bathroom (for water-based dyes) and sometimes the kitchen (for hot chemical-based to dye the ropes. After that, I have to take them to roof to get them dried. There is an attached veranda my room. I have decorated that for my work and photography. For weaving more oversized products, I use my bedroom. The veranda space is enough to pack small products, but for the larger ones (swings), I have to move to the living room. After that, I stack all the packaged products in one corner of the living room, ready to dispatch. This process creates much mess in the rooms that need immediate cleaning just after the work is finished. So I prefer working for 10-12 orders at a stretch and then having a clean apartment at least for 2-3days. " -Parijaat (pseudo name), 21 yrs old, Undergrad student Phrased another way, Parijaat's Veranda for relaxation is transformed into a full-time studio, bedrooms into raw material storage cum preparation space, kitchen and toilets into dying spaces, and living room into marketing, packaging, and storage spaces. Such a shift in the space use pattern of a modern dwelling unit poses questions to the rationale of the space division in the modernist design approach.</p><p>Case 5 Nazifa (pseudo name, 22 yrs old, undergrad student) complained to us about the west-facing kitchen of her apartment. In modern apartments of Dhaka city, the kitchen is usually placed on the west side to ensure thermal comfort to the rest of the apartment. The hot-humid climate of Dhaka makes the west exposures extremely uncomfortable for hours-long stays, especially at night. Since it is assumed that not many people will cook/work in the kitchen after the sunset, it is rational to put the kitchen on the west side of an apartment. However, being a full-time student at a local university, Nazifa only gets time to cook for her Facebook-based food business at night. Nazifa's page offers homemade dry foods (chips, local cakes or Pitha, sweets, Nadu, laddu, etc.) for snacks delivery services at locations. Since her business is still she does not want to lose any potential customer. Hence, she takes as many orders as possible. Usually, her customers order a before they want their food. Often Nazifa has to work till 3 am to finish cooking for the next morning's orders. She says, This and three more stories from our participants demonstrated the problem with their west-facing kitchens and their ongoing practice of cooking at night or cooking for a longer to satisfy F-commerce demand. They are trying to add ceiling or standing fans to control the heat, which is even riskier in terms fire hazards. and Nazifa's cases explain the limitations of modernist thinking around arranging occupants' functions in a spatiotemporal framework of an apartment. The 'rational' arrangement of spaces in an apartment does not provide much scope to accommodate spatial changes based on the dwellers' temporal needs. With the emergence of F-commerce, new programmatic or functional demands are being generated within the thresholds of an apartment. Like these two cases, many other stories from our participants explain how modern apartments' floor plan layouts are failing to respond to these new, dynamic functional demands from the occupants. This phenomenon points toward the rationales behind modernist notions of space allocation and organization and necessitates enough spatial flexibility in an apartment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repetition</head><p>New functional demands induced by F-commerce have also started to question the repetitive design and construction model of modern housing systems. While most building types, such as office buildings, factories, hospitals, theatre, shopping complex, and educational institutes respond to unique programmatic conditions and are rarely consistent and repetitive (unless chains like Burger King, Walmart, etc.), modern housing aggregates based on repeating <ref type="bibr">[155]</ref>. The design methodology involves developing prototypes of dwelling units and repeating those to achieve the required number of units in a building or a housing complex. Although the built form of modern housing differs from country to country responding to building regulations, climate, construction techniques, and density, the basic organizational possibilities are not many in <ref type="bibr">[155]</ref>. Such repetitive design models are assumed to be rational to support the one-dimensional requirement of modern dwell, for a large number of people rammed in a limited urban space. However, F-commerce mediated unique functional demands are not syncing with these repetitive, modular designs of modern housing. The following case explains this situation.</p><p>6 Fariba (pseudo name, 28 yrs old, entrepreneur) and Ananya (pseudo name, 37 yrs old, school teacher) live in the same 10 storied apartment building in the northern part of the city. Fariba lives on the second floor, Ananya on the eighth. Their apartment are exactly the same. Fariba bakes and decorates cakes for various occasions and sells those to her customers with whom she is connected through her Facebook page. Ananya, on the other hand, is a full-time school teacher, and she runs a side-business selling Indian three-pieces (women attire: salwar, kamiz, and through her Facebook page. When they tried to fit two different commercial activities in the same planning layout of the same building, they experienced various forms of difficulties and had to improvise in two different ways in their apartments.</p><p>Ananya, through her connections, imports Indian women's at-How she does that goes beyond the scope of our paper, hence, are not documenting that part of the story here. In the beginwhen she received her new lot of supplies, she used to store in her children's bedroom. Her school-going children did not have much space left to do their daily activities. They kept com-Moreover, her two-bedroom apartment (1 living, 1 dining, 2 bathrooms, 1 veranda, and kitchen) did not have a proper space to do product photoshoots or a Facebook Live session from her page to attract more customers. To solve these issues, she converted one corner of her bedroom into a permanent "Facebook Live corner" by decorating the wall with wallpaper, arranging some shelves and a display table, mannequin, and proper sound and lighting setup. This arrangement consumed almost one-third space of her room. To store the products, she attached a set of cabinets with the ceiling of veranda. Every day, after school, she gets her products from veranda storage, holds a Facebook Live session from her page, collects orders the session or people inbox her after the session, sorts the sold products accordingly, prepares packages for and stores the rest of the products in the veranda again. Fariba, on the other hand, tried to extend her kitchen to make enough space to bake and decorate cakes. However, the building managing committee did not allow her to break any walls inside her apartment. She then started working in the dining space. Eventually, her family members started to complain since making fondant cakes much time, and they needed to use the table for meals several times a day. After failing to accommodate the spatial demands of her business, she tried to rent another apartment from the same building to carry on her work, making the whole apartment into a giant kitchen. No apartment owner was interested in renting out their apartment to her. Fariba later managed to rent an apartment in another residential building close to her house. She converted the apartment into a cake lab. She says, new apartment I rented has two bedrooms, a dining and a living room. I converted one bedroom into official workstation, which includes my PC setup and from there, I conduct the marketing-related works. The other bedroom is used for making the cork sheet moulds and structures for multi-storied cakes. The baking part is mostly oven-based, hence, done in the dining space. But preparing cake mixes is done in the kitchen. After baking, decoration and packaging are done in the living space. During decoration, I have to maintain a particular room temperature; otherwise, the fondant does not set well. The air cooler I placed in the living helps. I work here from 10 am to 7 pm daily. The apartment owner put some restrictions on the crowd and security. He was convinced when I assured him that only 3-5 people (helping hands) would be coming here regularly. There are two other F-commerce offices in that residential building. The rent is higher than usual since I use the apartment for commercial purposes. There are not any fire protection facilities in the building. So I to check and recheck the electrical appliances before leaving the apartment. " -Fariba (pseudo name), 28 yrs old, entrepreneur.</p><p>Both Fariba and Ananya tried to fit the spatial requirement for their home-based F-commerce activities within their apartments.</p><p>Ananya somehow managed to do so, the same floor plan and the spatial organization did not help Fariba continue working at her home. Fariba complains that half of her income goes to pay the rent for an additional apartment. Her profit margin has narrowed down significantly for renting a separate apartment. case explains how the notion of repeating the same unit or plan tens or hundred times to produce "easy to design, build, and maintain" multifamily modern housing building/complex is being challenged by the unique functional demands of women Fcommerce entrepreneurs. The demand for spatial flexibility inside an apartment (we documented in the "Rationale" subsection) ultimately advocates against such repetitions of the dwelling unit</p></div>

Increasing urbanization and industrialization generate "colonies of migrants", where, the pressure of poverty and absence of social belonging, extended kinship structure does not hold much value <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[46]</ref>. Modern housing responds toward such notion of detachment from kinship structure. For instance, dwelling units are designed to accommodate the immediate family members of a working person. Moreover, modern housing has fueled the detachment of women from the design and materialization of the domestic sphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[105]</ref>.In traditional housing, women participated directly in the construction process by making/weaving/arranging building materials. They had a voice in spatial organizations as well. This practice actually helped the women to claim ownership in their domestic domain. Modern construction techniques, materials, and scale, however, have alienwomen from modern housing and converted it entirely into a "man's domain" <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[105]</ref>. The following cases discuss how emerging F-commerce activities respond to such detachments (kinship and gender) posed by modern housing.</p><p>7: Mubasshera (pseudo name, 22 yrs old, undergrad student) lives with her parents in the southern part of the city.

She receives orders from her friends and friends of friends on Facebook. Mostly they want custom-made t-shirts for different occasions such as group picnics, birthdays, valentine's day, father's/mother's day, etc. Mubasshera's father migrated to Dhaka when he was an undergrad student at Dhaka University. His family is still living in Khulna. Mubasshera's mom is from Dhaka.</p><p>her extended family members live on the other side of city. Extreme traffic does not allow them to visit their relatives very often. Mubasshera sometimes needs help to finish her t-shirt orders on time, especially during her exams. She says, " Three of my cousins are undergrad students like me, and they like what I do. One of them helped me during my exam last semester by managing my Facebook page, responding to my customers, and uploading my new works with proper captions and prices. I wish, like my grand parents' house, we could all live in the same building. So that they could help me anytime, I needed. I do not earn much to hire help. Also, no one else will be caring as my cousins since they are my family. We could expand this business as a family business. But this apartment too small even to accommodate one more from our extended family." -Mubasshera (pseudo name), 22 yrs old, undergrad student.

She could use some help from her extended family members if her apartment had some provisions for that. The question then comes, will adding another bedroom solve this issue? According to Mubassera, her grandparents' house (more than 60 years old) had a unique way of organizing the rooms, where each family could have their privacy while living together in the same house. According to her, modern apartments do not follow such design approaches and the design makes it very uncomfortable for dwellers if extended family members live with them for a longer period of time.</p><p>Case 8: Nishat (pseudo name, 39 yrs old, entrepreneur) makes sells achaar or pickles from her very popular Facebook page. She can make tens of different kinds of from locally available seasonal fruits and vegetables. She started this business after she married. For the last 3 years, she has been trying to make her business bigger. Although it started with one order per day, she is now delivering more than 50 jars of a day. Increasing demands from her customers ultimately forced her to hire two helping hands, who help her in shopping, sorting, chopping, packaging, delivering. Nishat is using one of her 3 bedrooms as the processing and packaging space, kitchen for making achaar, and two refrigerators in her dining space to store the jars of until the delivery process starts.</p><p>Nishat and her husband own this apartment in an eight-storied building. There are 32 apartments in their building in total. At first, nobody from her neighbours had a complaint against venture. When her orders appeared to rise, some of her neighbours started to complain to the managing committee about the smell of the spices she uses while making achaar. Also, there was another concern of security associated with her using the roof for sun-drying vegetables and fruits. When the managing committee told her to stop her business without listening to her standpoint, she had to raise at one managing committee meeting her voice to her business going. She says, "Although I am an owner of this apartment, being a I do not feel welcomed to these bi-weekly meetings of our managing committee. Only male owners appear in these meetings. They usually arrange these meetings at the ground floor parking lot, which does not provide enough privacy for women. I attended one meeting two months ago to discuss two issues. First, I a spare key to use the roof of the building to sundry some fruits before making achaar. It was difficult me to collect the keys from the watchman every time needed to use the roof. Second, what to do with the smell. When I was trying to talk, the committee president cut me off in the middle and asked my husband to explain the issues. My husband hardly knows anything about my business, and he could not explain the situation appropriately. When the committee decided that I had to stop my business, I could not control myself. I told them about my rights to use common spaces for activities that are not harmful to others. I can exhaust my kitchen with more powerful fans so that the stairway does not smell. But they need to listen to me first before making a decision. My female friends, who live in apartment complexes, also face similar problems. Management committees pay less attention to the women owners or dwellers in the building than the men. This very alarming for those women, who are involved in home-based F-commerce.. " -Nishat (pseudo name), 39 yrs old, entrepreneur.</p><p>Nishta's case explains how the women are often alienated from a housing building/complex's social, cultural, and/or management issues and hence experience spatial marginalization. Although we directly connect such marginalization with the existing patriarsocial framework, the salient features of modernization (as we have mentioned before) fuel spatial detachments of women like within this framework. She believed her involvement with F-commerce might raise many issues in the future in her apartment building since that involved using the common spaces of the building (e.g. roof, staircase, etc.). To keep her business going, she needed to be more vocal about her rights. She also started to unite the other women from her building to become aware of their spatial rights in their building.</p><p>These and many other stories from our study reveal that Fcommerce is generating conversations around the re-attachment with extended kinship structure and active involvement of women in the housing management system (within the patriarchal framework), which have been absent in modern housing culture for a long time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DISCUSSION</head><p>In the sections above, we have documented a selected set of cases that present how various forms of home-based F-commerce activities are challenging the modernist approaches toward housing designs. Our findings highlight how such practices question the rationales around modernist floor plans, strategic spatial measurements and distributions, and infrastructural systems. We have further reported how "easy" navigation oriented "official orders" of the residences are being superimposed by the new hybrid orders, since F-commerce activities add new locational stories. Moreover, our cases have demonstrated how homogeneous and repetitive planning algorithms of modernist design pose constraints on Fcommerce entrepreneurs. We also have explained how modernist housing designs that induce various forms of kinship genderbased detachments are being critically examined by the residents involved in F-commerce. Our findings generate several vital takeaways for HCI and architectural/urban design researchers that we presented in the following paragraphs.</p><p>6.1 F-Commerce in Urban Bangladesh and HCI Residential buildings and neighbourhoods are now accommodating various types of small-scale business initiatives and hence, producing functional heterogenization in a given space. For instance, documented the stories of a cake lab and online apparel business in the same residential building. Tens of similar Facebook-based online entrepreneurial entities might be appearing or going on in a neighbourhood. However, since these activities are happening within the "four walls" of the apartments, the emerging functional heterogeneity in a neighbourhood is not becoming visible in the physical or digital world. On the one hand, the absence of visual representation of such transformations limits the scopes for these entrepreneurs to leverage the maximum services their neighbourhood can offer to them. For instance, if an apparel trader gets informed there is a tailor in the next building, providing services through a Facebook page, they can collaborate and new opportunities On the other hand, negligence toward such transformations can generate potential threats to life and wellbeing. For instance, multiple catering businesses in one building increase the possibility of a fire hazard in a densely populated area. Hence, the ongoing heterogenization needs to be mapped and visualized locally to potential data for the residents, entrepreneurs, local leaders, architects, planners, and policymakers. mapping projects have been done in previous years in various parts of the world (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">147]</ref> for example). However, mapping functional heterogeneity in neighneeds extra attention since the privacy, safety, and security of the women entrepreneurs are attached to their household cum business locations. Design, development, and deployment of mapping tools and further integration of these data with F-commerce platforms need to be analyzed concerning these entrepreneurs' relative position in the broader political context.</p><p>Valuation: Our data further reveal that the products or serthese women entrepreneurs are selling on social media hold an additional value, which is often the outcome of overcoming many blockades posed by modernist approaches around spatial design. Our cases demonstrate that the "rational" floor plans are not providing much scope for easy programmatic swapping. Therefore, many participants from our study are sacrificing their personal space to grow their businesses. Our study also shows that the detachment from extended kinship induced by modern design often burdens these women. Moreover, the modernist transformation of 'house' women's domestic sphere to men's symbol of status in public sphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[105]</ref> often results in the alienation of women from the managing role of a housing complex. Hence, using common spaces (roof, staircase, lift lobby, etc.) for F-commerce purposes becomes chalfor many women entrepreneurs, as we have seen in our case study. All these efforts add an intangible value to the products and services that these women list on Facebook. Although in Facebook and pages, they get a slight scope to associate their products with the background struggles (through posts, photos, comments), Facebook Marketplace can hardly comprehend such values. The linear design of Facebook Marketplace with focuses on advanced engine [71], listing and categorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[145]</ref>, and consumerto-consumer connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[145]</ref> rarely succeeds in translating and transferring those values with the listed services or products. In other words, Facebook Marketplace devalues the products and services of these women and makes them ordinary quantifiable items. Mim, in her work on non-secular computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[117]</ref>, has made a similar argument around devaluing religious commodities through digital marketplaces. All these tensions create a space for "adverdesign" <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[50]</ref> that we would like to put forth in this work. To make women's labor, struggles, arts, and crafts more visible and to put them in conversation with the modern, secular, and capitalist design, this paper urges the future work to explore HCI design in feminist design methodologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">170]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1.3">Regionalization:</head><p>Along with the struggles of the home-based entrepreneurs, our findings surface many spatio-cultural appropriations of F-Commerce activities that happen at a very level. For instance, arranging local support to deliver products/foods/services sold on Facebook, clientelizing through comments on Facebook posts and conversations on Facebook Messenger, developing Facebook groups or pages to initiate supporting mechanisms (i.e. online organizations) for the entrepreneurs-all these measures point toward the necessity of introducing regionalization in design and development of F-commerce's digital features. While decentralization of social networks has gained attention in many branches of social media studies 191], regional appropriation of social media marketplace interfaces is still understudied. In many cases, the universal interface designs for marketplaces fail to grasp the complexities around local/cultural commercial activities. Such phenomena often marginalize the entrepreneurs and their clients <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[117]</ref>. Hence, social media marketplaces, such as Facebook and its associated F-commerce services, need to regionally respond local/regional market economy, market forces, and and shopping Let us provide an example here. One of our participants opines that shopping in urban Bangladesh is a popular group activity. During festivals, such as Puja, and Bengali new year, family members prefer to go to shopping centers and share the fun of shopping together. Family members respect each other's opinions while buying a new dress/ shoe/ home decor items. Younger generations learn how to bargain and buy products considering the family income. With some shops and their owners, families even develop a bonding for generations. Hence, group shopping provides entrepreneurs with an opportunity to build a long-term client base. On the other hand, on Facebook, shopping is an individual activity that takes place through individuals' personal accounts. The current marketplace interfaces do not much scope for a family to experience the group interactions and the fun around group shopping. Entrepreneurs who work hard to develop their client base, also miss the opportunity to build a longer-term relations with their clients and their loved ones.</p><p>is a particularly local/ regional aspect that is much different the present-day Western shopping culture, where everything in a shopping center comes with a price tag, one can hardly find any owner/ product maker to know about their business/ products on display, discounts are offered considering the profit/loss calculations-not out of respect toward a generation-long relationship with a client family <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[34]</ref>. Hence, similar to "group shopping" feature, Facebook marketplace should regionally embrace many other cultural aspects around shopping and reflect those in designing and developing interfaces. Design literature in HCI has now long been engaged with such value integration: from Friedman et "value-Sensitive Design" <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[60]</ref> to Le Dantec et al's "values as lived experience" <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[106]</ref> to Houston et al's "values in repair" <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[80]</ref>, which needs to be brought in developing this space of F-commerce in the South.</p><p>6.2 F-Commerce and Housing Design 6.2.1 Rethinking Development Sequence: Our findings portrayed how our participants are making alterations, additions, or adjustments in their apartments to accommodate various F-commerce activities. We argue that, on the one hand, this phenomenon is forcing local architects and interior designers to do "touch-ups" in an already built apartment to support this new functional demands of the occupants. On the other hand, this phenomenon questions very notion of the sequenced and systematic process of modern housing development. In the modern sequence of development, an receives a land property dedicated for residential purposes (determined by the city land-use plan) as their site of work. The (developer or individual landowner) explains their requiresuch as the expected number of apartments they want for families of a particular economic background, budget for construction, the estimated date for completing the project, etc. After the site visit, demographic and environmental analysis, the architect and their team prepare architectural, structural, mechanical, and fire safety drawings following Bangladesh National Building Codes (BNBC) and submit those to the RAJUK (the public agency responsible for coordinating Dhaka's urban development) for approval. The construction begins right after the approval. Simultaneously, the developers start selling the apartments to their target group showing floor plan types and rendering the architect's team produces. In this sequence, the ultimate purchaser or tenant of an apartment at the very end and has no or minimal voice over the final (apartment) they receive. However, the F-commerce induced re-purposing of spaces is generating a huge "customer-base" for these modern apartments, who do not share a common spatial anymore. Instead, hundreds of business types are creating hundreds of unique spatial demands in apartment design. Hence, voices of the apartment dwellers need to be heard in the design and development phases. The question is where and how, in this very "top-down" modern sequence of housing development, we need to incorporate their voices. Various co-design tools can help conversations among future apartment dwellers and architects/designers <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">152,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">158]</ref>. However, without understanding the political of this sequenced development <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[23]</ref> proper integration of such voices would be difficult to achieve. 6.2.2 Re-evaluating Building Codes: We argue that F-commerce induced re-purposing of also questions the applicability and validity of modern land-use planning that determines which areas in a city will be developed for residential purposes. With the emerging "patches" of F-commerce activities, residential plots are transforming into something else, which might need different kinds of infrastructural support (for instance, increased water supply, uninterrupted electricity, wider lanes or pocket spaces for loading and unloading), and floor area ratio (FAR). Modern building codes also need to be revisited to ensure the apartment dwellers' privacy, and security. We suggest that learning from home-based economic sectors and informal housing might help us to beyond the application mechanism of a set of rules or codes that are not flexible enough to incorporate changes easily (see <ref type="bibr">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">143,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b172">177]</ref> for example). However, without understanding the trajectories of technological advancement and its appropriation by local communities, architectural or planning interventions would be valueless. This study hence invite HCI scholars, urban planners, architects, engineers, local community representatives to converse, collaborate, and co-create sustainable living and built environments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Digital Empowerment and Postcolonial Women:</head><p>the design implications mentioned above, for both HCI and architecture disciplines, our study advances the postcolonial arguments in the design space. Postcolonial HCI highlights how postcolonial subjects interact with the computing systems develin the West, how such interactions often get shaped by their histories of subjugation, and how their local values often contradict with the western values embedded in the computing artifacts or <ref type="bibr">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b164">169]</ref>. In our study, we have seen that the urban Bangladeshi women are trying to empower themselves economically through F-commerce and calling for the removal of the spatial constraints that the modernist architectural design has imposed on However, the question remains: to what extent this advocacy their own voice and to what extent it is shaped by the market that has emerged through the F-commerce platform? one hand, these women, through the newly achieved economic power can bargain with the patriarchal society under the capitalistic system, which in turn, as our findings demonstrate, allows them to make some small changes to their household living condition. On other hand, that very economic power is dependent both upon liberty they may achieve through the architectural freedom that their living condition allows at the present, and the flexibility they get on the Facebook interface. This interesting relationship architectural liberty and digital empowerment points to the underlying larger issue of suppressing women's voice in design -both in modernist architecture and in the capitalist digital market. A narrative of this complexity might boil down to the statement a woman is only so much powerful in changing the oppressive modernist architecture as much the neoliberal digital F-commerce market is allowing her to be. This tension demonstrates a classical contention in the study of South Asian feminism <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[111]</ref>, Islamic feminism <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[38]</ref>, Chicana feminism <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[12]</ref>, and many other non-western feminist movements.</p><p>context of the postcolonial South Asian women is well depicted in Gayatri Spivak's seminal work, "Can the subaltern speak?" <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[162]</ref>,</p><p>the colonized woman is forced to make a choice between liberation and traditional oppression, neither of which she admires. Similarly, our study demonstrates how one modernist economic system-F-commerce, with its speed, scale, rationales, and pragmatic concepts, is replacing another colonial modern Utopian vision around the housing system in the Global South. A large number of Bangladeshi women, with a hope to break the shackles of economic dependency and deprivation, are becoming entrepreneurs the platforms like Facebook, only to find themselves the subject of their problematic surveillance, algorithmic biases, and media manipulation. And thus, the true 'empowerment' of a postcolonial woman in urban Bangladesh still remains a dream to them. To end, our paper invites both the future HCI and Architecture researchers to further explore this tension and help the "subalterns" of our study-the women entrepreneurs in Bangladesh, seek their</p></div>

Other big cities like Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi, and Barishal are also involved in F-commerce, our study did not cover. Moreover, the adoption and response F-commerce in rural neighbourhoods were also beyond the of this paper. We have studied only the formal, modern apartment housing buildings and complexes. This study did not include the impact of F-commerce activities on the bungalow houses of the wealthy neighbourhoods or the informal slums. We acknowledge the findings might reveal new information there. We also have not discussed the complexities and confusions around formalization and taxation [5] of F-commerce and its potential impact on Facebook users and their business models. We did not include the stories around the complex supply chains of the products that our participants were selling on Facebook. The gendered lens throughout the study might exclude the experiences of the other genders around F-commerce and urban housing. Hence, we refrain from any generalization of our findings beyond the studied setting. We rather focus on the significance of such empirical studies in depth of data and richness of details. By using critical interpretive tools our study, we presented a deeper understanding of the practices our field.
