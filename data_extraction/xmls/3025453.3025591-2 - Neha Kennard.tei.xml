<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Technology is often viewed as either positive or negative. On one hand, in HCI, weight loss apps are usually seen as a positive influence on users. From the sociocultural perspective, on the other hand, media and technology negatively impact body satisfaction and contribute to eating disorders; however, these studies fail to include weight loss apps. While these apps can be beneficial to users, they can also have negative effects on users with eating disorder behaviors. Yet few research studies have looked at weight loss apps in relation to eating disorders. In order to fill this gap, we conducted interviews with 16 women with a history of eating disorders who use(d) weight loss apps. While our findings suggest these apps can contribute to and exacerbate eating disorder behaviors, they also reveal a more complex picture of app usage. Women's use and perceptions of weight loss apps shift as they experience life and move to and from stages of change. This research troubles the binary view of technology and emphasizes the importance of looking at technology use as a dynamic process.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Many young women use mobile health applications for weight loss (weight loss apps). As of January 2014, 51.7% of the 46 million people who used apps from the health and fitness category were women <ref type="bibr">[52]</ref>. According to Neilson, the most popular health app during this time was MyFitnessPal, an app that allows users to track calories, exercise, and weight, with 8.7 million users [52].</p><p>Women's motivation for using these apps is often to lose weight even if they are technically at a healthy weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[51]</ref>. With the pressure to be thin and beautiful, some women have an unrealistic and distorted view of their bodies. In fact, in North America, there is such a pervasive body dissatisfaction and preoccupation with weight that psychologists have developed the term "normative discontent", which describes the "normalcy" of being unhappy with one's weight as a woman <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>.</p><p>From the sociocultural perspective, much of this dissatisfaction is driven by the media and now technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>. The sociocultural model of eating disorders posits that "disordered eating is a result of internalizing the increasing pressures for women in Western society to achieve an ultraslender figure/the thin ideal, which current cultural trends emphasize as an essential component of beauty" (p.1225) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. With this obsession with weight and size, women may engage in extreme and even dangerous behaviors to achieve an unattainable idea of beauty -even when losing weight is unnecessary. Some of these women develop eating disorders as a result. In fact, it is estimated that 35% of "typical dieters" develop eating disorder behaviors, and of those, 20-25% develop partial or full eating disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Few research studies have looked at weight loss apps as a type of new media that may contribute to or exacerbate eating disorders. Yet weight loss apps often contain the same types of content as other technologies that have been shown to worsen body dissatisfaction and disordered eating. In Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), weight loss apps are often viewed as positive influence on users. In order to understand if weight loss apps contribute to eating disorders, we wanted to hear stories from women with a history of eating disorders who use or have used weight loss apps. We used semi-structured interviews with 16 participants in order to get in depth and detailed descriptions of their experiences. One primary research question guided our study: How do women with a history of eating disorders use weight loss apps? What emerged from this data is a complex perspective of how weight loss apps are used. While there is evidence to suggest that weight loss apps, like other technologies, may contribute to and exacerbate eating disorder behaviors, how these apps are used and users' perceptions of these apps change over time. This finding "troubles" the typical binary view of technology. That is, instead of technology being seen as only positive or negative, the role of technology can shift depending on where users are in their health "journey". This should be of growing interest to the HCI community because viewing technology as just good or bad neglects the larger picture of how technology use changes depending on user needs. Specifically, our study shows women with eating disorders reflect on and use apps differently as they go through their eating disorder journey. Our research has implications for the design of more health-focused apps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BACKGROUND Eating Disorders</head><p>While it is estimated that 20 million women in the United States have an eating disorder, many more have unhealthy eating behaviors or may be undiagnosed <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">48]</ref>. It is estimated that 8%-17% of college-aged students have an eating disorder, and 20% of college students believe they have had an eating disorder in their lifetime <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">34]</ref>.</p><p>For the purposes of our study, we focused on behaviors associated with anorexia and bulimia nervosa and other specified eating disorder/eating disorder not otherwise specified because there is some overlap between these disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Eating disorder behaviors related to these disorders include excessive calorie or food restriction, intense fear of gaining weight, obsession with weight and consistent behavior to prevent weight gain, self-esteem overly related to body image, bingeing, feeling of being out of control during bingeing, purging, dramatic weight loss, preoccupation with weight, food, calories, fat grams, and dieting, refusal to eat certain foods, comments about feeling "fat", hunger denial, excessive exercise regimen, and development of food rituals. Some eating disorder behaviors may be viewed as typical to achieve weight loss or not severe enough to warrant medical attention. Research has shown that even women of a healthy weight may utilize "weight loss methods" indicative of eating disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref>. Additionally, research has shown that 25% of college women in the United States have engaged in bingeing and purging as a weight loss method <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[48]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sociocultural Perspective of Eating Disorders</head><p>While biological and psychological factors play a role in an individual's predisposition and development of eating disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, researchers in psychology have highlighted the sociocultural perspective -that social and cultural factors play a significant role in the development and prevalence of eating disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. This perspective is used to understand how social and cultural factors, such as traditional media, affect an individual's mental processes and behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref>. For example, it has been used to understand the impact of media on body image and eating behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. For quite some time, research has shown that media exposure contributes to body dissatisfaction and disordered eating <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref>. However, much of this research has focused on conventional mass media, such as magazines and television.</p><p>In recent years, researchers have been calling for more work in understanding the impact of new media, such as online content, on the thin ideal, body image, and eating disorder symptomology <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref>. From this perspective, technology is viewed as a negative influence on users. Recent work has shown that online content, such as social media, is associated with poor body image and eating disorders, especially among women <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">42]</ref>. Many online weight loss and fitness communities either overtly or subtly promote eating disorders, and this negatively affects users who are trying to address their eating disorder issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">45]</ref>. Researchers in psychology have recognized the importance of understanding the effects of new media on eating disorder symptomology.</p><p>However, their focus has largely been on social media. For example, using Facebook is correlated with drive for thinness in women and men <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref> and body dissatisfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">42]</ref>. Mabe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref> found that frequency of Facebook use was related to disordered eating. Similarly, Stronge et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref> found women and men of all ages are more likely to have poorer body satisfaction if they use Facebook. Kim and Chock <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref> conducted an online survey to examine Facebook's impact on users' body image attitudes. While they did not find a correlation between time spent on social media and body image concerns, they found engaging in particular social media behaviors such as checking friends' profiles, leaving messages, and commenting on profiles is correlated with a drive for thinness in both females and males.</p><p>Even HCI researchers who study eating disorders have primarily focused on social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">30]</ref>. Some researchers have found that social media promotes eating disorder behaviors. For example, Chancellor et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> found that despite Instagram's strategies to reduce pro-eating disorder content, pro-eating disorder communities still exist and are thriving. Similarly, Pater et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref> analyzed hashtags on Tumblr, Instagram, and Twitter and found proeating disorder-related hashtags, images, and text. While this work is important because many people (especially young females) use social media, research is lacking on the role of weight loss apps. Additionally, this perspective only considers media and technology as a negative influence; whereas our study looks at weight loss apps as both positive and negative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Health Apps for Weight Loss, Diet, and Exercise</head><p>We add to the HCI literature on food journaling, selftracking, weight loss and persuasive technology. In HCI, many researchers focus on how weight loss apps are positive influences on users. Specifically, weight loss technology is often seen as a way to help people combat obesity and obesity-related health conditions. Thus, the focus is on designing apps to motivate users to eat less or healthier, exercise more, and use the app long-term <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">49]</ref> and how this technology contributes to users' ability or their perception of their ability to achieve health goals, such as weight loss and exercising <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">28]</ref>.</p><p>These apps can be useful weight loss tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr">38]</ref>, but they may also trigger unhealthy eating and exercise behaviors by creating a dependence on logging food, exercise, and weight. Tan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref> found that users felt weight loss and fitness apps could be both helpful and harmful for eating disorder recovery but did not elaborate further. Prior to weight loss apps, some people (including those with eating disorders) tracked their diet and exercise on paper. While this can still negatively impact eating disorder behaviors, weight loss apps are more personalized, discreet, mobile, and quicker to use. They also provide users with precise values for food and exercise and visualizations of weight loss and calories consumed/burned with an added component of the app "rewarding" them for eating less, exercising more, and losing weight.</p><p>Recently, some HCI researchers have been challenging the narrative that quantifying behaviors and logging is always positive or appropriate. For example, Cordeiro et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> considered the use and problematic aspects of food journaling for a general population, where the focus is to encourage logging. Similarly, Cordeiro et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> discussed how in self-tracking, quantifying behaviors are pervasive but not always appropriate because of user goals. Purpura et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref> fictional Fit4Life is related to our work because they discussed problems of persuasive technology. They call for us to expand our criteria beyond BMI because it is not a good measure of health and explore unintended consequences.</p><p>Our study directly contributes to prior HCI work. Like other researchers, we also believe the quantification of behaviors is not always appropriate but investigate the use of existing self-tracking tools to understand how users' needs are not being met. Our study looks at the issues of weight loss technologies and unintended consequences but in the context of eating disorders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Recruitment</head><p>To be eligible for the study, participants (1) Had to use/have used weight loss apps, (2) Be an 18-25 year old woman, and (3) Have/had an eating disorder (symptoms related to anorexia and/or bulimia nervosa). Although eating disorders are increasing among men <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>, we focused on women because they are more likely to develop eating disorders <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>. Because some people do not meet the full criteria for a specific diagnosis and because many people never seek treatment for their eating disorder, we recruited both participants who were formally diagnosed and those who were not. We posted flyers at the university and at public locations around the local town. Each participant was compensated $25.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection Sessions</head><p>The first author conducted all data collection sessions. Each session consisted of a survey, a think-aloud exercise, and a semi-structured interview. Through the survey, we obtained demographic information as well as history and status of their eating disorders. For the think-aloud exercise, we asked participants to go through 3 tasks: (1) setting goals, (2) viewing progress visualizations, and (3) using social and community features. After the think-aloud exercise, we moved into the interview portion of the study, which focused more on their perceptions of the app and technology use in general. The think-alouds showed us how users used the app and provided us with concrete examples of goals set, calorie budgets, etc. During the interview, we asked users to reflect on how they have used the app over time, show what made them feel negative and positive emotions, explain how the app changed their behaviors, and discuss what aspects were helpful to recovery and exacerbated ED symptoms.</p><p>The think-aloud exercises were video recorded. The entire discussion was audio recorded; thus, transcriptions represent both think-alouds and interviews. Each session took anywhere between 40 minutes and 1 hour and 45 minutes. We conducted a total of 16 sessions because we saw repetitive themes in participants' responses (i.e., data saturation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[25]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>The audio files from the data collection sessions were transcribed into electronic format (approximately 278 pages). This was appropriate because the goal was "to analyze the content of communication" to understand the participant's experience (p. 2937) <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[50]</ref>. Then we used thematic analysis to identify themes across the data set <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. As participants explained their use over time, we noticed a lot of discussions about "before" and "after", so we first grouped discussions according to users' descriptions of when they first started to use the app and then after they changed their use/stopped using the app. We then developed initial codes, searched for themes, and reviewed and grouped them together, which led to the final themes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINDINGS</head><p>We first present information about our participants. Then we discuss how their app use changed over time. Finally, we provide quotations from participants that exemplify their experiences. Specifically, we focus on:</p><p>1. Disordered use of weight loss apps (such as obsessive logging, need to be exact, acute awareness of numbers, restricting, manipulating the app to lose weight, compensatory behaviors, manipulating the app to avoid negative emotions), 2. Making a change (such as adding in calories and/or focusing on nutrition and taking a break from apps), and 3. Falling back into old habits.</p><p>These showcase the participants' journey of weight loss app use as many reflected on their eating disorder and app usage over time. multi-racial, and 1 identified as Native American or American Indian. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, most participants had not been professionally diagnosed with an eating disorder (n=12), and most reported being in recovery or recovered (n=13). Participants estimated they had an eating disorder anywhere from 2 months to 7 years, and their eating disorder behaviors included extreme restriction, obsession with "healthy" foods, bingeing, excessive and compensatory exercise, purging, and extreme anxiety and concern related to food and weight. Most (n=13) felt their eating disorder began before using weight loss apps. Participants reported using weight loss apps between 2 months and 8 years (mean of 35.63 months or 2.97 years with a standard deviation of 31.92 months or approximately 2 years). The most commonly used app was MyFitnessPal (n=15).</p><p>Founded in 2005, MyFitnessPal 1 has become one of the most popular weight loss apps <ref type="bibr">[52]</ref>. It allows users to create a diet plan by entering their height, starting weight, goal weight, weekly weight loss/gain goal, and activity level. Users can enter their foods by searching the database of foods, manually entering calories, or scanning barcodes, and they can input exercise manually or by synchronizing other apps or wearables, such as Fitbit. The app also allows users to track nutrients, such as carbohydrates, and set nutrient goals. MyFitnessPal provides visualizations of calories consumed/burned, weight loss, and nutrients. Users can also choose to connect with other users through adding friends, messaging friends, participating in challenges, and posting on the MyFitnessPal forums.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patterns of Use</head><p>Participants discussed not only their current use of weight loss apps, but also their past use and how it has changed over time. Because many participants have been using weight loss apps for over a year (and some many years), they shared how their eating disorder influenced their app use and how the app impacted their eating disorder. Most participants also felt they were in recovery from their eating disorder, which gave them the opportunity to reflect on how they arrived at this point in their health journey. In fact, some participants actually referred to their eating disorder and subsequent app experience as a journey.</p><p>In hearing their experiences, a pattern of use began to emerge as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The lines in the figure represent bidirectional arrows. In the beginning, participants' intentions were most commonly to lose weight (whether or not they were at a healthy weight). When they first began using weight loss apps, they found them helpful in losing weight and tracking their foods even though some of their behaviors were disordered. A number of participants describe how their diet and tracking sort of "spiraled out of control". As time went on, participants began to think that they may have an eating disorder and that the app was exacerbating it. Upon this realization, participants would either decide to use the app as a tool to eat more or stop using the app altogether. However, participants often began using weight loss apps again and felt they were battling their eating disorder mindset even when recovery was the focus. We showcase their journey by providing quotations regarding their experiences of (1) using the app in a disordered way, (2) deciding to make a change, and (3) falling back into old habits.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Disordered Use of Weight Loss Apps</head><p>During the height of their eating disorders, participants talked a lot about the ways they used weight loss apps in an unhealthy manner (even though they did not often recognize their behaviors as disordered early on) and ways the app impacted them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Obsessive logging</head><p>A number of participants explained that they became obsessed with logging their food and began using the app multiple times a day. One participant talked about how she felt the need to log everything she ate:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>"I got more hung up on tracking everything. Before I could just eat something. I didn't have to worry about logging it into something. I didn't really keep track of it throughout the day…. Then the ability to track it only made it [eating disorder behaviors] worse… Definitely before [recovery], it was really bad. Like I would get on there [the app] a few times a day, like more than the 3, and just be very obsessive about it." [U02]</head><p>Similarly, another participant discussed how obsessive food logging and tracking turned into an eating disorder:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>"I started to diet and that's kind of how my eating disorder manifested itself, after the diet became an obsession with tracking my food and how low I could get the number basically… When I was in the middle of my eating disorder, I would definitely use it [the app] everyday. And it was one of those things where I would pretty much try and track everything the day before." [U06]</head><p>These participants explained that they used the app many times a day everyday to the point that they felt compelled to log and track their foods and check the app.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Need to be exact</head><p>Participants also talked about how they felt the need to be exact with recording their calories and macronutrients.  Many participants discussed how they used the app to help them achieve exactness when tracking calories and macronutrients. Using the app fueled this desire to be exact and resulted in anxiety if they did not know the precise amount of calories and macronutrients in the foods they were eating in order to log them accurately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acute awareness of numbers</head><p>Weight loss apps also tend to put an emphasis on numbers associated with foods and exercise. As participants discussed, this focus on numbers worsened their eating disorder behaviors. One participant talked about how the app made her more aware of calories, which fed into her need for control: The heavy focus on the numbers in weight loss apps was problematic for a number of participants. By providing a way to monitor their diet so closely, the app fueled their need for control.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">"I</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Restricting</head><p>One way participants maintained control was through restricting their calories. Participants described how they felt encouraged by the app to continue to restrict and accomplished when they ate under their daily calorie allotment. One participant described how she was almost in competition with herself and the app to eat fewer calories each day: Participants discussed how the apps could contribute to their restrictive behaviors by making it seem like a game to eat less than the given amount and less than the prior day. By seeing that they ate under their calorie budget, many participants would feel a sense of accomplishment, which fueled their desire to continue and even intensify their restrictive behaviors.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">"I kind</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manipulating the app to lose weight</head><p>Some participants talked about ways they manipulated the app so that they were actually netting less calories than the app stated. This was often achieved by not honestly reporting information about exercise and activity level. For instance, one participant talked about how she reported her activity level as "sedentary" even though she was really active so that she would lose more weight quickly:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>It [the app] only takes you as low as 1200 calories because that's a regular diet would recommend, the lowest you can go. So I would adjust my diet… I put in I wasn't active even though I was really active, so my maintenance calories were already lower than they should have been. And then if I put in like lose 2lbs per week, it would be even lower. So I feel like that can be manipulative… I think it can easily spiral into like disordered eating." [U03]</head><p>Another participant explained how she would do a lot of calorie-burning activities and then go to the gym but never log calories burned from exercise:</p><p>"I was dancing 4 days a week for like 2-ish hours and then I was swimming 4-5 days a week for 1-2 hours as well as thinking I needed to start lifting. So I would in between all that, go to the gym 4 times a week and lift up the 10lb dumbbells, so my calorie expenditure was probably 3000-4000 calories a day,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>and I was eating 1000… I didn't [record my exercise]. I don't think I ever recorded it simply because I knew I was doing so much." [U06]</head><p>These participants manipulated their calorie budgets and expenditures by not accurately inputting their activity level and exercises. Without exercise, the app told them that they would lose weight, so being more active than reported acted as buffer or a means to more quickly achieve weight loss.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compensatory behaviors</head><p>While participants felt rewarded by staying under their daily calorie allotment, sometimes they would exceed those budgets, and the app would reflect that. Participants often purged through exercise but sometimes vomited. Many talked about how they restricted their intake more the following days to compensate for being over budget. The apps are designed in a way that allows users to "remove" calories eaten by adding in exercise. Participants often talked about how they would utilize exercise as a way to compensate for going over their calories for the day. They also would eat less in the days following exceeding their calorie budget.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manipulating the app to avoid negative emotions</head><p>Exceeding the calorie budget almost always resulted in negative feelings, such as guilt and shame. In order to avoid those feelings, some participants would not log their food if they knew they would exceed their allotment. One participant talked about how she felt devastated when she significantly exceeded her calorie budget, so she would rather not enter it on the app: The act of logging those foods and visualizing the calories on the app made it seem "real", which resulted in too much guilt and shame.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Making a change</head><p>Many participants explained that at some point they began to realize their behaviors and thoughts associated with food, exercise, and body image were unhealthy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adding in calories and/or focusing on nutrition</head><p>One way participants changed their app usage and oriented their use towards recovery was by slowly adding more calories to their diet and focusing more on nutrition. Through the app, they logged additional calories as well as macronutrients. This essentially taught them that they could eat more, which reduced their fears around weight gain. One participant talked about how adding calories and tracking macronutrients helped her recover: While participants were still logging their foods, they began to change their perceptions around food, which helped them in their recovery.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">"I</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Taking a break from weight loss apps</head><p>Sometimes participants felt the best course of action for their recovery was to stop using the app. For example, one participant talked about how ceasing use really helped her recover:</p><p>"[sigh] I took a break from tracking, like the past year, I stopped using the app and just kind of started eating like a normal person again, and that was really nice so. I think everyone should do that, and I think that's really what has helped me.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>" [U06]</head><p>Another participant described how she stopped using the app when it consumed too much of her time and she was having anxiety attacks about food:</p><p>"I went to a psychologist on campus… because I was so anxious. And if I would binge-eat, then it would have been binge-eating of vegetables because I was so anxious about gaining weight. Just something at some point after a long miserable, I think semester at least, I just said no more and this is crazy. Nothing should drive me nuts, like food. So that's when I said, 'I'm going to erase it [the app], I'll be fine.' Then I would cheat a little bit, like I would remember everything. So I would write down on a paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I had this and this and like add it up and do a calculation in my head. But that's when I erased it [the app], when it was just occupying me and energy-wise and time-wise just to insanity really." [U12]</head><p>At some point, many of the participants stopped using weight loss apps at least for some period of time because they thought it would help with recovery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Falling Back into Old Habits</head><p>Although a number of participants took a break from using weight loss apps, many of them began using weight loss apps again. Even when participants had recovery goals in mind, they wanted to use weight loss apps to keep track of their foods or to lose weight. Some participants described pressures to lose weight and be fit as a result of being athletes or fitness competitors, and they felt the app in some ways was the only way to achieve that: While participants were interested in supporting their recovery, they often felt the need to continue to use weight loss apps either to help them reach athletic and fitness goals or to relieve anxiety around food and weight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Our findings highlight two sides to weight loss apps, troubling the binary view of technology. On one hand, they can exacerbate and contribute to eating disorders. On the other hand, users use apps for eating disorder recovery. We further discuss how our findings trouble the binary view of technology and then provide insights from our study that are useful for designing more health-focused apps and technologies in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Troubling the Binary View of Technology</head><p>Typically, studies talk about technology as either a negative influence or a positive one. For example, from the sociocultural perspective, technology negatively impacts body image and eating disorder behaviors while much HCI research views weight loss apps as beneficial to users. Our findings show that weight loss apps can be both negative and positive. In line with the sociocultural perspective, there are aspects of weight loss apps that contribute to and exacerbate eating disorder behaviors, such as the heavy focus on numbers, which fuels obsessive logging, makes users want to be exact, changes the relationship with food, and allows them to manipulate the app to lose more weight; and calorie visualizations, which make users feel rewarded for eating under and guilty for eating over their budget and contribute to their need to exercise to compensate for calorie consumption. Therefore, some users, especially those who are still struggling with eating disorder behaviors and poor body image, can easily be triggered by using weight loss apps. In the right mindset though, users who are trying to add more calories into their diet or focus on nutrition may find it helpful to track their foods and alleviate anxiety around weight gain.</p><p>As this study demonstrates, focusing on a binary view of technology is problematic because technology is neither inherently good nor bad. Thus, the context around technology use is crucial in understanding users' needs and the effects of using health technology, particularly when talking about eating disorders. While many users believe weight loss apps can be problematic for those with eating disorders, many stated the effects of the app depend a lot of how users use them and users' own mentalities, attitudes, and motivations during use.</p><p>Users go through stages of use and report both positive and negative effects of the app at these various stages. As users reflect back on their journey, they talk a great deal about the negative effects of the app during the early stages of use. However, when they first began using the app, they often did not realize their behaviors were indicative of an eating disorder and even found the app helpful. Users then often begin to realize their behaviors are unhealthy. Sometimes users continue using the app to restrict calories or "erase" calories. However, some decide to make a change to be healthier or focus on eating disorder recovery. Users are motivated to make a change due to personal reasons, such as realizing the health implications of their eating disorder (e.g., having a low heart rate, infertility). Sometimes parents discover their daughter has an eating disorder, and they intervene by making her see a professional, ceasing use of the app, or controlling her meals and exercise. Other times, users make a change because of the social dynamics in college, which often center on food (e.g., going out to eat, eating at the dining commons, going to parties, etc.). In order to participate in the "typical" college lifestyle and maintain friendships, users decide to stop using the app, use it less frequently, or use it differently (i.e., changing calorie budget). Unfortunately, because of the way in which weight loss apps are designed and the nature of eating disorders, users sometimes revert to old habits of unhealthy eating and exercising or begin using the app when they feel it is not healthy for them. This reflects users' journey of not only how they used weight loss apps, but also how they perceived them in relation to their eating disorder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Weight Loss App Design</head><p>Although weight loss apps can be used in both positive and negative ways, there are certain aspects of weight loss app design that need to be reconsidered in order to focus more on promoting health. This study highlights ways weight loss apps may unintentionally promote unhealthy habits or lead to negative emotions. For instance, we found users manipulate the app to avoid negative emotions, such as guilt, when they exceed their calorie budget, which is in line with Cordeiro et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> findings about food journaling and negative nudges.</p><p>When users exceed their calorie allotment, that number turns red. This happens regardless if the user exceeds their allotment by 1 or 1000 calories. Many participants talked about how seeing this number displayed and how "seeing the red" made them feel anxious and guilty. In order to alleviate these feelings, participants would either exercise to "get back in the green" or not log when they knew they would exceed their budget. As Cordeiro et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> suggested, it is not necessary to make users feel so guilty for going over their budget, especially by little amounts, as this may actually cause users to feel badly, resort to extreme measures, or not use the app at all.</p><p>When users net fewer calories than they are budgeted, many weight loss apps show their calories remaining as a green number. We found users felt the remaining number in combination with the green color encouraged them to try to eat under their allotted calories or purge (most often through exercise) to "remove" calories from the app. Consuming fewer calories gave participants a sense of pride and achievement, which they felt was intensified because of how the app showed their food and calories. Interestingly, this is in contrast to Cordeiro et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, who found general users did not feel strong positive emotions for eating under their calorie budget and seeing the green did not make them feel rewarded, which highlights how different users are impacted differently, showcasing the interaction between eating disorders and app design. Thus, we should reconsider how we visualize being over or under budget as red and green have strong emotional responses based on how they are used throughout society. These visuals need to be more nuanced, perhaps using different colors. Future work needs to explore different types of feedback and visualizations and test for their impact on different types of users, including those with eating disorders.</p><p>Our findings also show users often become obsessed with logging, which is in line with Cordeiro et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. HCI has typically viewed breaks from logging as negative or a barrier; however, we should reconsider this viewpoint as breaks can be healthy for users to eat "normally" and listen to their body's signals. For instance, users with eating disorders often find taking a break from using the app helps them in the process of recovery. However, contrary to Cordeiro et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, users with eating disorders do not really "lose the habit" of logging because they feel the need have control over their food, diet, weight, etc. This begs the question of how much and how often we should tell users to log? For some, we should encourage logging breaks, monitor how often they use the app, and recommend less use.</p><p>We found weight loss apps create a need to be exact and an acute awareness of numbers. While this awareness was mentioned in Cordeiro et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, it was not as extreme. In HCI, this awareness is often viewed as a positive, but our work shows that it can promote an unhealthy relationship with food. While Cordeiro et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> found users were challenged to log because of the variety of foods they eat, for users with eating disorders, such an awareness is created around calories that users eat the same types of foods repetitively because they are "safe" foods. To counteract these issues, apps should focus more on healthy behaviors like eating nutrient-rich foods and a variety of foods. This number focus is not necessarily in line with healthy lifestyle promotion, as echoed in Cordeiro et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> findings about apps being about ease of tracking (easy to log fast food and pre-made food).</p><p>Contrary to Cordeiro et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> who found the eating context was a barrier to journaling, instead of not logging, users with eating disorders will preplan for or avoid social engagements or scenarios where they might be challenged to log; if they cannot preplan or avoid it, they feel anxiety, which helps to perpetuate their eating disorder.</p><p>When we try to discourage users from certain behaviors, we have to make sure we're not unintentionally encouraging negative habits. For example, users saw a warning message of eating too little as an accomplishment. It may also be helpful to eliminate the ability to cancel out calories through exercise and instead allow users to track exercise but do not show a deduction in calories consumed.</p><p>Because users manipulate the app to lose weight, perhaps we can find other ways to determine user needs besides selfentering. For instance, apps could synchronize with wearables that give users a sense of what they need but do not show the quantifications to users. This falls in line with Purpura et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref> who cautioned that weight technology focuses too heavily on quantitative measures and "promotes behaviors based on limited understanding of users' actual personal situations" p429.</p><p>Currently these types of apps do not support recovery goals or weight gain goals, which helps explain why users may fall back into old habits even when they have recovery goals. Some apps do not allow weight gain goals, and if they do, then they are not designed to persuade users to gain (green if under not over even if you have a weight gain goal). More personalization could help. For instance, if users have a weight gain goal, then when they exceed their budget, they should feel a sense of accomplishment as they are moving toward their goal. Current apps do not support this nuanced aspect of goal setting. We need to reconsider how we motivate users based on their individual needs.</p><p>There should be a shifting focus away from just weight loss as a marker for health, and we need to find ways to support this in apps. Future research needs to study the effects of design in more detail on various types of users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>We trouble the binary view of technology by showing that as users reflect on their health journey, they report both positive and negative effects and perceptions of weight loss apps. In fact, women go through a journey of weight loss apps use as they change and go through different stages of their eating disorders. While every user's journey is somewhat different and the timeframe between disordered use and making a change varies, there are patterns of use that exist across users with eating disorders. This study demonstrates the dynamic nature of weight loss app use, which is important for designing weight loss apps that promote health.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
