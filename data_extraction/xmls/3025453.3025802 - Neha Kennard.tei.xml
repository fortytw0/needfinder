<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Motivations and attitudes towards activities -leisure and otherwise -can be complex. For example, watching television can be considered both a pleasurable pastime and a waste of time. Yet, leisure activities are a source of meaning and enjoyment for many individuals, including older adults. For this paper, we define a leisure activity as "uncoerced activity engaged in during free time, which people want to doâ€¦ in either a satisfying or fulfilling way" <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[72]</ref>. For older adults, leisure activities can provide opportunities for self-expression and personal fulfillment Researchers in HCI have begun discussing the predominant focus on social isolation and health issues in older adulthood, which leads to technological 'solutions' that compensate for perceived deficits rather than looking closely at this population's actual needs and interests <ref type="bibr">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">82]</ref>. As this conversation develops, researchers are turning to other areas of older adults' lives, such as gaming <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[27]</ref>, financial practices <ref type="bibr">[79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">80]</ref>, and creative engagements with technology <ref type="bibr">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">63,</ref><ref type="bibr">75]</ref>. Though some of this research touch on individual leisure activities, the HCI community is currently missing a clear understanding about older adults' motivations to engage in a variety of leisure activities and the ways they decide activities constitute leisure activities. In this paper, we turn our focus towards leisure activities in older adulthood, and find that leisure activities are actually intertwined with health and wellness.</p><p>Based on interviews with twenty-four older adults living in independent living communities, we elucidate the nature of leisure activities that older adults participate in and the ways that they take into account motivations and other factors. We discuss implications for the design of technologies and detail ways that the intertwining of leisure and health and wellness both complicates and contributes to the discussion on the overemphasis on health in design for older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">82]</ref>. This paper has three contributions: 1) A layout of the societal and ecological factors which influenced participants' leisure activities.</p><p>2) A description of motivations for participating in various leisure activities and a more nuanced understanding of why these individuals perceive activities as leisure activities.</p><p>3) Design considerations around these findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RELATED WORK</head><p>Below we discuss research on leisure activities from HCI as well as gerontology. We also provide an overview of successful aging, a concept in gerontology that provides a useful lens to understand older adults' leisure activities. Leisure activities are important to individuals throughout the lifespan, and have been an active area of research in older adulthood. Benefits from engaging in leisure activities for older adults include opportunities for self-expression and personal fulfillment <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> and can be helpful for managing difficult situations <ref type="bibr">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr">40]</ref>. Engaging in certain leisure activities have a number of health benefits, and are associated with higher cognitive functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[50]</ref> and a lower risk of dementia <ref type="bibr">[78]</ref>. Additionally, engaging in leisure activities is associated with greater mental wellbeing <ref type="bibr">[41]</ref>. Although people engage in leisure activities throughout their lifespan, the leisure activities individuals engage in can change as they age. For example, older individuals tend to continue watching television and listening to the radio, but may travel less as they age <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[74]</ref>.</p><p>Engaging in leisure activities in older adulthood fits into the concept of successful aging. Successful aging is a prominent model in gerontology <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref> that is based on "avoiding disease and disability, high physical and cognitive function, and engagement in life" <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[73]</ref>. This model has permeated the discourse of popular media <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[65]</ref>, biomedical literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>, and policy <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>. It is partly responsible for the widespread conception that older adults benefit from engaging in activities -particularly physical and cognitive activities -as they age. Indeed, this model was developed in reaction to previous models and societal views that associate older adulthood with inactivity and posit that individuals should withdraw from activities as they age (i.e. disengagement theory <ref type="bibr">[33]</ref>). Research has confirmed that participating in certain leisure activities provide older adults with the ability to resist narratives that frames aging as a period of decline and inactivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">51]</ref>.</p><p>Although successful aging has been beneficial in encouraging individuals to continue to engage in activity in older adulthood, it has also faced criticism for framing individuals who can and do engage in certain types of activities (e.g. competitive sports) as exemplars. This inadvertently reinforces negative attitudes towards individuals who cannot or do not engage in these activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">51]</ref>. Furthermore, this model poses youthful states of health as the ideal and does not take into account normal changes that may accompany aging <ref type="bibr">[46]</ref>. It also has been criticized for overemphasizing the individual's role in staying healthy rather than taking into account social, economic, and political factors that affect the ability to maintain health (e.g. not being able to afford medications) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">67]</ref>. Researchers in HCI are beginning to reflect on problematic aspects of successful aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">82]</ref>, and this work contributes to that discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent living communities in HCI</head><p>The model of successful aging has permeated many settings, including some of the places in which older people live. Certain independent living communities have been described as providing "societal scripts in successful aging," in terms of how their advertising materials depict only healthy individuals whose days are filled with activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[52]</ref>. Independent living communities often house a variety of planned leisure activities, and some individuals describe access to these activities as motivation to move there <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>.</p><p>In HCI, one vein of research has studied interactions between individuals living in independent living communities. For example, technologies have been proposed to monitor <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[59]</ref> and increase <ref type="bibr">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">58]</ref> interactions in common spaces. One system was designed for residents to register for activities in an independent living community <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[57]</ref>. Though researchers have designed to increase interaction and activity in independent living communities, less understood is the ways that older adults are already engaging in activities and how the communities in which they live affects their activities. Recent research has identified the way aging is often treated as a "problem" in HCI (e.g. resulting in the loss of physical and cognitive abilities) with technology treated as a "solution" <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[82]</ref>. Adding to a rich area of research on leisure with the general population (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">24,</ref><ref type="bibr">30]</ref>), researchers have begun to design technologies beyond health and social needs for older adults. These researchers have expanded into areas of leisure activities such as creating and sharing media <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">85]</ref>, games <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr">71]</ref> and "creative technological explorations" <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[63]</ref>. For example, researchers designed an online social gaming site for older adults to play poker [71], and planned a workshop to expand beyond 'functional' goals (e.g. maintaining stability in walking) to explore more 'hedonic' (i.e. for the sake of pleasure) aspects of game play for older adults. However, in gerontology, leisure activities such as playing games or maintaining social connections can actually be considered in the realm of health. In this paper, we contribute an analysis that details the ways older adults' hedonic and functional motivations for engaging in leisure activities are actually intertwined.</p><p>Critiques of HCI research include that older adults are regularly framed as technologically illiterate <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">81]</ref>.</p><p>Recent work in HCI counters this perception, demonstrating the many ways that older people integrate technology in their day-to-day life and leisure activities, such as creative personal projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[38]</ref>, communication <ref type="bibr">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">36]</ref>, gaming Participants were recruited from independent living communities as people in these communities may experience more constraints on their activities but also more opportunities for social interaction and activities than those living in their own homes. The four independent living communities are located in Northern California, USA, and range from 80 to 183 residents each (average of 120). We attempted to recruit participants with a range of income levels by recruiting from communities that ranged in the rent they charged, with some specifically housing low income seniors. As of 2016, the rental rates of ranged from $450 USD to $5,300 USD per month.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Twenty-four participants took part in the study, with an average age of 79.4 (ages ranged from 60 to 96). Twentythree participants identified as White and one as Asian. Twenty participants lived alone in their apartment and four shared an apartment with others. Nineteen identified as female and five as male. Though males only made up 20% of the participant base, this matches the gender ratio at the communities (the four sites combined have a 24% male population). Towards the end of the study, we began purposely recruiting men to increase their representation in the study. Although we did not ask participants to disclose health conditions, they were brought up by participants during interviews. Conditions included those affecting mobility (e.g. arthritis, Parkinson's), mental health conditions (e.g. depression), and other conditions (e.g. hearing impairments).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Data analysis followed a grounded theory approach [14]. Five transcripts were initially coded to generate themes using open and axial coding. Some of the initial codes included transportation and available activity, which related to the high-level theme of access. The researchers agreed on a codebook and additional themes were added as all additional transcripts were analyzed. We began to see the data in terms of social and critical gerontology, which is a body of literature that takes into account the ecological and societal factors that construct 'old age' <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[65]</ref>. With concepts from these bodies of work in mind, we iteratively coded data and related the codes and emerging concepts to each other through a process of memoing and theorizing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>The participant base is limited in terms of gender and racial diversity, and participants were asked to limit the majority of their discussion to activities they did in their apartment and the independent living community. These factors likely constrain the types of activities participants did and spoke about. Furthermore, participants were interviewed once and thus the data does not capture changes that occur over time beyond what participants described. The participants in this study did not describe financial considerations as significantly impacting their lives, but other older adults live with severe financial insecurity. This study does not address this population, though we call for future work in this area. Additionally, the majority of older adults do not live in independent living communities. However, the unique features of independent living communities merit their own examination. Finally, as in all studies of this nature, there is a risk of self-selection bias, with individuals who are more engaged in activity more likely to participate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINDINGS</head><p>Participants described a wide variety of activities that they considered to be leisure activities. Watching TV, reading, and playing games was mentioned by the majority of participants. Many participants mentioned using the computer, interacting with pets, gardening, writing, and learning. Some participants described activities that were not shared by others, such as one participant who collected and sorted buttons. Some activities were considered leisure by some participants and distinctly un-leisurely by others, like exercise and eating. In part, this was due to the ways that motivations to engage in leisure activities were negotiated in the context of societal and ecological factors. Below, we describe these factors as well as motivations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Societal Factors</head><p>Societal factors are the ways that predominant societal narratives and attitudes towards aging affected how individuals engaged in leisure activities. Participants chose leisure activities that helped them stay busy and preserve </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Staying busy</head><p>One component of successful aging is "high engagement in life" <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[73]</ref>, and participants described days filled with activity. They shared an acute dislike or even fear of inactivity and boredom.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>"I'm never bored because I feel like there's always something to do, alwaysâ€¦ if I had a few minutes and I wasn't doing anything else, I'd work a puzzle or something, to keep me occupied." [P19] "I don't know what I would do if I really got bored, and [watching TV] prevents that." [P17] So, if I didn't go to [visit] my husband [in a nursing home], I don't know what I would doâ€¦ In one way it is good. My time is taken up." [P5]</head><p>The way participants described needing to keep occupied aligns with the concept of a "busy ethic" that describes how "retirement is morally managed and legitimated on a dayto-day basis" <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[23]</ref>. This ethic is aligned with successful aging and is motivated by a system of beliefs that "esteems leisure that is earnest, occupied, and filled with activity" <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[23]</ref>. Participants presented other older adults who did not adhere to the busy ethic as counterpoints to themselves:</p><p>"Some of these old ladies don't do anything. They come home, they sit; they don't watch TV, they don't read, they have no company, they have no phone calls -they are just there.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>" [P12]</head><p>"Too many older Americans will sit with the remote and they don't move, they don't get up, they just watch game shows or whatever and their minds are not challenged at all. I don't think that's very good, very healthy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>" [P2]</head><p>Successful aging has been criticized for emphasizing a normative ideal that devalues older adults who have not successfully maintained abilities through activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[65]</ref>, and this can be seen in the ways that participants described these other older adults. Furthermore, successful aging places responsibility on individuals for staying active, disregarding ecological (e.g. transportation) and other factors (e.g. depression) that affect abilities to do so <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[67]</ref>.</p><p>Participants in this study placed blame on individuals for inactivity, as staying busy was described as a personal responsibility to seek available opportunities.</p><p>"Some people in here, they always say they're bored..</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>. I say that's their own faultâ€¦ They don't participate in enough things." [P3]</head><p>Other participants, while still disparaging inactive older adults, described factors that resulted in some individuals being "legitimately" inactive. In other words, ecological factors such as limited transportation made disengagement inevitable for some individuals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>"At 10 o'clock he is still there on the computer playing games, so that's his lifeâ€¦ I realize that that's all he has to keep going on, and I'm lucky to have a lot of friends, a lot of people who are saying 'let's go do this,' and so my life is very filled." [P1]</head><p>"There are people around here that all they do is watch TV, but they're in their 80s and 90s. I hope I never get to that point, but I probably willâ€¦ I don't want to sit around watching TV all day long. But people that don't drive around here, they have nothing else to doâ€¦" [P23]</p><p>Interestingly, though participants spoke about turning to television to stay busy, the television was also described as the main or even sole activity of other, inactive residents.</p><p>Participants described the importance of having many other activities going on, with television providing a way to fill time in between activities. Watching television was not a leisure activity in it of itself; the amount of time spent watching was a contextual feature that determined whether it was considered a suitable leisure activity. We return to the importance of contextual factors in the discussion.</p><p>Though the narrative was largely of activity-filled days, some participants expressed resistance to this idea. This too had a rationalizing component, with participants conveying that they had already 'put in their time.' By having worked hard earlier, these participants described having earned the luxury of not having to always be busy.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">"</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maintaining physical and cognitive abilities</head><p>Keeping busy was tied to a larger narrative around how, with enough activity and effort, participants could maintain physical and cognitive abilities -the "use it or lose it" mentality. Participants described participating in leisure activities such as Mahjong and crossword puzzles in order to maintain these abilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>"â€¦ they [crosswords] start on Monday very easyâ€¦ If I can do a Saturday, I feel like I've conquered the demons of old age." [P22]</head><p>This notion of "defeating age" through activity has been found in other studies, where older individuals describe being motivated to continue engaging in competitive sports by the fear of becoming "old" or "dependent on others" <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[20]</ref>. Some participants in this study discussed how they had found information that these activities would preserve their abilities from external sources. This is not surprising given the ways that successful aging dominates the </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ecological Factors</head><p>Community resources such as computers, as well as a variety of other environmental and logistical factors affected the types of leisure activities that participants engaged in. Interestingly, though many participants described that they were limited financially in terms of certain activities they could do (e.g. international trips), they largely were able to find solutions to other activities, such as borrowing books from the library instead of buying or ushering at shows instead of buying tickets. However, Technology Use Challenges for Older Adults CHI 2017, May 6-11, 2017, Denver, CO, USA they faced a variety of other factors that they described as more difficult to navigate, which we detail below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Access to transportation</head><p>Access to transportation was the most significant ecological factor that affected participants' leisure activities, which is aligned with findings from gerontology on the importance of transportation (for an overview, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[18]</ref>). Though some participants drove, many described how not driving severely affected their lives: one participant explained that it "really confines you" [P5]. Even when public transportation or shuttles were available, there were various issues such as the ability to seat wheelchairs and walkers and the need to schedule in advance. Learning to navigate the world without a car was an issue that affected the types of leisure activities participants engaged in. Participants who had the most difficulty were in the process of transitioning to not having a car, such as P16, who said: The constraint of being limited in terms of offered activities that meet P8's desire to stay active did not particularly affect her, as she had ample transportation to engage in the activities she wished to do elsewhere. She recognized it would only affect her once she lost her ability to drive, at which point she would "enjoy" those activities. Different factors intersect in ways that affect how participants decided what activities constituted leisure activities.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">"I think part of</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motivations for Engaging in Leisure Activities</head><p>Societal and ecological factors provided a backdrop against which participants negotiated motivations to engage in leisure activities. In this section, we describe these motivations. We found prior work (De Schutter and Malliet's work on the needs of older players of digital games <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[69]</ref>) useful as it aligned well with many of the motivations described by participants in this study. This prior work described five categories of motivations (which they refer to as perceived needs): cognitive, affective, individuality, connectedness, and escapism. We expand on these categories by looking at leisure activities beyond digital gaming. The additional categories of motivations are physical motivations and accomplishment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cognitive motivations</head><p>Cognitive motivations are "the desire to acquire knowledge, information, or skills" <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[69]</ref>. In other words, learning itself is a leisure activity. P7 explained, "learning is my hobby." Participants were motivated by satisfying curiosity and being informed. Many participants described learning by watching informative television programs and reading.</p><p>Cognitive motivations also include when participants describe "excercis[ing] the brain" <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[69]</ref>, or the importance of learning to maintain existing cognitive abilities. Many participants recognized specific activities, such as crosswords and learning new things as being beneficial for this purpose. P3 watched informative TV programs "To learn, for the brain not to die," and P2, who noticed himself forgetting things and learned Japanese as it was a:</p><p>good mental exercise in remembering. Some people have really good memories when they're <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">80</ref> Participants also described motivation to engage in physical activities in order to maintain physical abilities. P15, who had had a stroke, said that:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>have a tendency not to want to move sometimes, and that is when I get myself in trouble, because then I get all stiff and my leg doesn't want to work and my brain doesn't to work right. That is why I read and watch and watch the birds. I try to multi task all the time, you knowâ€¦ I try to keep active because when I stop being active then I will die." [P15]</head><p>Like cognitive motivations, physical motivations are in part driven by societal factors such as staying busy to maintain abilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accomplishment</head><p>Despite the inquiry into digital gaming (with its common of achievements and badges), De Schutter and Malliet's categories did not touch on the desire to engage and finish activities for the sense of accomplishment. Researchers are drawing attention to the distinction between momentary pleasure (hedonic) and striving for accomplishment (eudaimonic) <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">70]</ref>. Many participants were motivated by both, and the latter is discussed in this section. Diverse activities contributed a sense of accomplishment, included writing, reading, sewing, and crossword puzzles. The main element that led to feeling the sense of accomplishment was completing an activity, sometimes regardless of how challenging the activity was. Regarding doing crafts organized by the activity director, P12 said, "We accomplish something. I don't say I learn a lot because it is all stuff that you have done since kindergarten." Yet P12 still enjoyed a sense of accomplishment, saying she enjoyed "getting something cute that you make, even though it is [a] piece of junkâ€¦ I think anybody that sits down and makes something feels satisfied, don't you?" Other participants felt satisfaction from activities with tangible outcomes. P24 described that she enjoyed knitting and crocheting because she was "something that I need, and so I am accomplishing something." P3 described the satisfaction she experienced when she received positive feedback from others, saying, "When I finish, I love to be told it's beautiful." P3 gave away most of the needlepoint she made to others.</p><p>"The need for individuality encompasses a collection of desires: autonomy, positive self-esteem, status, authenticity, and identity" <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[69]</ref>. Participants were motivated to do activities that aligned with a sense of identity, such as activities with which they had history and familiarity. Although some participants mentioned doing activities the sake of reminiscence or nostalgia, for others, it was due to having enjoyed a particular activity their entire life. P1 said, "I've done <ref type="bibr">[needlepoint]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>since I was in my teensâ€¦ Seems like it's become a part of me." [P3]</head><p>Participants described the ways that that they had always found compelling now felt familiar, and they often pursued activities that helped them maintain with their prior interests. Some participants described rejecting activities that not in line with their past or identity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>"They love sing-alongs. When I say 'they', I mean the average people here. And that's not my thingâ€¦ I am from New York and I have a different concept of things, I really do. A lot of them are Midwest, and they had a different upbringing, a different lifestyle." [P5]</head><p>Others were more open to new activities. Despite their openness, some faced barriers due to lack of experience given their personal histories:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>"I don't know how to play, maybe if I knew [I would]. I just happened to never have a group who did those thingsâ€¦ They did talk to me into playing cards one night but I think they found out I was a beginner."</head><p>Connectedness "The need of connectedness refers to the desire to maintain contacts with one's family, friends, or the world outside" <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[69]</ref>. Participants described deriving as a major motivation to participate in activities, and some described opportunities to interact with others as motivation for moving to independent living community over another type of housing. While some participants described feeling disconnected from other residents, many said that there were people in the independent living community that they could relate to or engage with. P8, who had recently moved to the community, said that "A lot of the people are very friendly here. And I feel very welcome, and there are people that like to see me and like to talk with meâ€¦" Technology Use Challenges for Older CHI 2017, May 6-11, 2017, Denver, CO, USA</p><p>Participants considered the process of obtaining companionship a leisure activity in it of itself (e.g. talking on the phone to friends), and also described participating in activities such as games because of the companionship of others playing the game. Some participants described engaging in activities that didn't satisfy other motivations identity or affective), but yielded them companionship through interactions with others. For example, P16 said, "Something that I had never, never, ever done before except when I was probably 10 was play bingo. I started going to the bingo games here and they are stupid and idiotic but they are funâ€¦ they are nice people to be with and that is essentially what it is."</p><p>Participants used technology to mediate relationships with others in order to derive companionship in a way they found satisfactory. Some preferred contact through email or text to manage the amount of spent this activity. Discussing staying in touch with her friends after explained:</p><p>"Some of them don't even have a computer or laptop, so you to take the time to call. They don't even text... It eats up a lot of time. We don't get to do as much as we'd like." Surprisingly, several participants also described deriving companionship through the use of technologies such as televisions and radios. P15 explained that she watched TV more than any other activity "mainly because I like the company that it gives me, and to hear other voices, and have somebody around -because I am a people person.." Though for some, companionship from the television was a substitute for human contact, others appreciated the unique characteristics of this alternate form of companionship. P21 appreciated a sense of unconditional approval that she received when watching television. She explained: "â€¦ I'm comfortable with the TVâ€¦ it's accepting to me. If I have to have someone come in, then my anxiety and nervousness kicks inâ€¦ I'm so insecure that the TV provides a very safe interaction... I don't want to be judged or criticized."</p><p>This participant identified unconditional approval as difficult to obtain from people than from her television. However, she also spoke of problematic elements of companionship from this non-human source. P21 explained that though she highly valued the safe interaction and ability to modulate her emotions through the media she with, being able to shape her world so carefully cut her off from the full human range of emotions, saying, is a crutch, because I feel good.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>If I don't like the program, [I] change it or turn it off. I rarely feel bad."</head><p>These findings are in line with recent work that challenges conceptions of older adults as unilaterally desiring more social contact <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr">48]</ref>. Participants in this study technology to manage their relationships with others, and sometimes intentionally used it to replace companionship from human sources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Affective and Escapism</head><p>In this section, we merge affective needs, which "refer to the desire to acquire aesthetic, emotional, or enjoyable experiences," and escapism, which "refers to the desire to run away from the strain of having to fulfill other needs or to perform other activities" These motivations were often intertwined, as participants often engaged in activities that they found to be enjoyable because they were entertaining, relaxing, or distracting. Many participants how watching movies and television was enjoyable because of its immersive quality. At enjoyable leisure activities were explicitly contrasted with activities that involve learning, which requires a certain level of alertness. P5 explained that she was struggling with the stress that accompanied visiting her husband who had dementia at a nursing home, and said, books are not intellectual, but I don't think I could even cope with anything that I really have to study. Because my mind is so full of everything else that I just want to relax, and the only way to do [that] is to read these books."</p><p>Other activities that were considered enjoyable were also used to get to desirable mood states. For example, P7 explained that he specifically watched uninformative TV shows "â€¦ just to change my emotional setting. Say, 'Big Bang Theory [television show],'... That's a lot of funâ€¦ I use it to laugh or smile." Like other participants, he drew a distinction between activities that led him to think -which he also considered leisure activities and those which were enjoyable to him in an affective and escapist sense. Although calming and distracting activities often had in common that they did not include learning, the activities differed for different participants. P3 explained that she enjoyed needlepoint because: "It keeps me nice and calm. When I'm working, I'm not thinking of anything else." And P4 described sorting buttons as "what I call naval scratching time. You know, some relaxation, something that relaxes me and interests me is [a] small joy." Participants sought out these diverse activities to relieve anxiety, distract themselves from troublesome thoughts, and relax. At the same time, many participants explained that they placed limits around how much time they engaged in these to ensure that they also participated in activities helped them maintain physical and cognitive functions.</p><p>Our findings reveal a range of factors that influence motivation to engage in leisure activity as well as two central factors -societal and ecological -that operate across these motivations. Below, we discuss what these findings mean for researchers in HCI. First, we contribute to the dialogue in HCI on successful aging and the medicalization of older adulthood. We then discuss implications for the design of technology in light of the varied motivations and factors that affect the ways older Finally, we provide a case example of applying these findings to the design of a common leisure technology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Redefining Leisure</head><p>This work calls into the way we define leisure in older adulthood. We initially sought to study leisure activities as a distinctly non-health related area. However, we found that a wide range of leisure activities in older adulthood can be considered health and wellness activities by participants (in terms of individual motivations), the communities in which they live (ecological factors), and according to a broader societal narrative (societal factors).</p><p>In other words, the tenants of successful aging, particularly the emphasis on physical and cognitive activity, are bound in the way older adults engage in leisure activities. Recognizing that many of the leisure activities that older adults engage in can be considered health and wellness activities has a variety of implications for improving the design of technologies for older adults, some of which we below. It also calls on us to question some of the experiences and activities that are currently neglected when we think about health in older adulthood.</p><p>At the same time, we must be cognizant of what it means to consider leisure activities under the same umbrella of health and wellness. Recent critiques of how we treat aging in HCI urge us to move away from medicalizing older adulthood and the predominant focus on physical and cognitive health <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">82]</ref>. The successful aging narrative is entirely harmful; there is a large body of evidence that engaging in activities is beneficial for older adults, and many individuals find meaning in engaging in activity throughout the life course <ref type="bibr">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr">25,</ref><ref type="bibr">40,</ref><ref type="bibr">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">50,</ref><ref type="bibr">78]</ref>. However, as a research community, we can reflect on which components of successful aging we incorporate into our technology design. The ways that we position certain populations and how values become embedded in technologies are areas that require continued study and reflection researchers becoming increasingly concerned this issue more broadly <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">60]</ref>. One conceptual shift that may be useful is framing studies on older adults in terms of motivations for wellbeing that exist across lifespan (e.g. accomplishment, escapism). This subtle shift can maintain focus on motivations that are important to this population while moving away from framework that associates older adulthood with deficits (e.g. declining cognition).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design Implications</head><p>Like previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[69]</ref>, we found individual motivations of participants to engage in leisure activities. To these, we add that societal and ecological factors impacted what activities individuals defined as leisure. Below, we describe design implications for researchers designing technologies to support leisure and health and wellness activities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications of leisure as a health and wellness activity</head><p>Given the ways that leisure activities are intertwined with maintaining health, our analysis contributes to the area of designing health and wellbeing technologies. In particular, we call attention to the ways that researchers -as well as older adults -may be overlooking health and wellness activities that older individuals are already engaging in. Currently, HCI researchers designing that attempt to harness older adults' interests in leisure activities to encourage them to engage in "healthy" activities. For example, researchers are using bingo to encourage older adults to engage in physical <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref> or cognitive exercise <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">61]</ref>. Bingo itself, though, is not seen as an activity to likely in part to being associate with older adulthood. However, engaging in activities such as bingo is actually associated with a lower relative risk of dementia <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[68]</ref>. Using Bingo to encourage other activities may not be the most effective approach, both because Bingo itself is already a cognitive and social activity, but also because of the conflicted feelings participants described towards activities such as Bingo (e.g. enjoying the company but wanting to avoid the stigma of an activity associated with people). A more effective route may be to design technologies that older adults in recognizing that they are already engaging in healthy activities when, for example, they play Bingo. This is supported by literature in gerontology that an individual's satisfaction with their leisure activity (e.g. considering what they do to be 'enough' or 'valuable') impacts their wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>This study presents additional motivations that researchers can take advantage of in the design of or health and wellness technologies for older adults. For example, in motivating older adults to exercise, have been designed to target the desire for social connectivity (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[31]</ref>) or fun, which we refer to as affective motivations (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[26]</ref>). Our analysis contributes additional motivations that could be incorporated into technologies for health, such as escapism and physical motivations. For example, designing for physical motivations could a setting where individuals can engage in somatic awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[35]</ref> to attend to the sensations of exercise. Researchers can also leverage multiple motivations, with an awareness that some motivations conflict (e.g. cognitive and escapism).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expanding past individual responsibility</head><p>The successful aging narrative emphasizes individual responsibility in maintaining health, ignoring systemic factors that affect older adults' ability to maintain their health and participate in activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">67]</ref>. When adopted by researchers, the successful aging narrative manifests in technologies that focus on personal responsibility to in activities, such as technologies to motivate social interaction and physical or cognitive exercises Though these are important areas of study, we can expand our focus to encompass technologies that move us past individual responsibility towards ecological and societal factors that affect in older adulthood.</p><p>In this study, participants discussed a variety of ecological societal barriers to activities that have been largely unaddressed thus far in HCI and point to future opportunities for design. Areas where HCI researchers can have real impact in the lives of older individuals, and have recently started to explore, include transportation <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">54,</ref><ref type="bibr">56]</ref>, economic opportunities enabled by emerging technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>, and platforms that challenge stigma <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[43]</ref>.</p><p>Researchers can take advantage of emerging technologies as self-driving cars and the technological infrastructure of the sharing economy. one potential area of study, researchers can support awareness of nearby activity opportunities. Though research has focused fostering social interactions between individuals living at a particular retirement community to meet motivations for connectedness, participants in this study also described motivations to engage in specific activities or (to meet motivations such as accomplishment and individuality) that were not supported in the communities they lived in. This situation suggests an opportunity to create platforms to pool resources of neighboring communities and community centers. such a platform, people of a certain skill level or interest from different communities can be connected to support leisure activities. Turning to societal and ecological factors rather than factors is aligned with calls from Social Justice-Oriented Interaction Design <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[21]</ref> and Feminist HCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">60]</ref>. Furthermore, future work should include individuals of low socio-economic status, who are particularly vulnerable to being marginalized by the successful aging narrative <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[34]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motivations and societal and ecological factors interact</head><p>activities are often thought of terms of discrete categories of pastimes (e.g. playing poker, reading). However, what participants defined as leisure activities actually depended on a variety of contextual factors, such as who was doing the activity, how long they were doing it for, and who they were doing it with, rather than what the activity itself was. For example, individuals described considering some activities as leisure activities solely because of the company with whom they did these activities -without the company, participants would not have been interested in engaging in that particular activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[84]</ref>. Researchers can study how to incorporate these context-aware systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[16]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specific example informed by this study: the television</head><p>In this section, we provide an example of applying the factors and motivations identified in this study to the design of the interactive television. The interactive television is an existing technology that is an active area of research in HCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">76]</ref>), Watching television is a common leisure activity across age demographics <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[77]</ref>, and in this study, watching television was frequently mentioned as a leisure activity. It is also activity that raised conflicting feelings in individuals who engaged in it (like gaming, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[24]</ref>). Interactive televisions incorporate additional functionalities such as social interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">76]</ref> and information seeking <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[17]</ref>. In some studies, researchers describe using televisions as a platform as they are likely to be more acceptable to older adults than computers (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>). However, largely left out of the discussion are societal stigmas around older people who watch "too much television." Previous studies have found that television viewing is embedded in the social context of the home and we add that it is also embedded in the context of societal narratives. While it is possible that incorporating other functions will make the television seem like a more societally sanctioned tool, it is also possible that participants will reject interactive televisions to avoid spending more time with the television. Furthermore, some participants described using the television to escape other obligations or stressful thoughts: it is possible that building in functions that come with obligations may detract from the restful time that is spent. One possible design direction is to create different that disable the interactive functionality. This could better allow for the ways that older adults currently flexibly use the television to alternatively fulfill both needs such as learning (accomplishment) as well as escapism. derived companionship from having the television and radio on, even when they were not watching (similar to findings in Addressing social isolation and new avenues of communication for older adults is an active and important area of research in HCI (e.g. <ref type="bibr">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">64]</ref>). The participants in this study, however, were engaged in social activities and most did not mention the need for additional ways to communicate with others, perhaps in part from living a community others. Participants explained that they actually treasured time not around other people, but enjoyed not feeling alone through the use of technologies such as the television and radio.</p><p>points for opportunities to study whether pre-recorded ambient conversation of loved ones playing in the background create a more meaningful source of non-human interaction, or, whether the anonymity of these technologies is what is desired. More importantly, it calls for us to question whether adding communication capabilities to a television will impinge on precious time alone a sense of obligation for older adults to respond. Our analysis contributes to an ongoing dialogue around the need to honor older adults' choice to not partake in interventions that aim to increase social interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[86]</ref>.</p></div>

Participants described motivations for engaging in activities as well as societal and ecological (e.g. access to transportation, planned activities) factors. Leisure activities were often intertwined with health and wellness activities. We present an analysis of how this contributes to a conversation on successful aging in HCI, implications for the design of technologies, and discuss the interactive television in light of these findings.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

For example, a number of participants mentioned age in the context of learning new things. Some seemed to be responding to a perception that older people should stop learning, such as P13 who explained that he considered reading a leisure activity because, "Even at my age I still enjoy learning." He followed up saying "Because even though I am 96, I still -I can learn things. It won't do me any goodâ€¦" Other participants embraced the notion that older people should not learn: P17 explained that though he enjoyed reading:"Some things I do read for information, but I'm sorry, at 94 I've quit studying. I don't read very often now to find out things that I didn't know before."</note></figure>

Several participants who had recently moved mentioned having to downsize, and as a result lost space or equipment such as sewing machines. P16 explained that "you began thinking okay [where do I put my] sewing machineâ€¦ I had a huge dining room table, that's gone, so you just change your priorities.Planned activities Communities offered different activities at different times, in part based on the activity director. Individuals explained how the time activities were scheduled (either by a director or a group of friends) affected their ability to participate: "I used to [play games more], but then they put it on a certain nightâ€¦ Sometimes I ended [finishing] up at 10:00 or 10:30 and that's too late for me, so I told them I'm not going to do that." [P23] Furthermore, as these activities have been tailored towards general community interests but not specific individuals, many participants described having interests that were not satisfied through planned activities. P8 explained:</cell></row></table><note>it first of all is adjusting to not having a car â€¦ I don't like to impose too much and if I can use the bus, I should use the bus. I know that and then I could go more places but it's like everything at this point requires some kind of help and I'm just not doing [what] I am used to, walking out and getting in the car."Participants described how the lack of a personal car meant that they had to schedule or plan activities, rather than engaging in them spontaneously. One participant said,"What I miss about not having the independence is spontaneityâ€¦ you have to come to get me or I have to get on a busâ€¦ [sighs] You have to have dollar bills. I don't have any dollar bills, so I have to go to the bank." [P22]Related to transportation, the independent living community's proximity to activities and infrastructures impacted participants' ability to attend community events, activities, and buildings (e.g. libraries or senior centers), particularly for those who could not drive. P1 explained,"I don't know whether I would do that [activity] if I weren't in a place which had the library right at your fingertipsâ€¦We have the old downtownâ€¦ like a block away, and the university is a block away. They have entertainment there and all sorts of activities over at the university." " Although P16 "used to sew a lot," she altered her priorities to better match what she could do within of her new home. Even when participants had the space or equipment to continue with their activities, living in an apartment building rather "â€¦the activities they offer, other than the exercise class are sedentary. I think that's probably why I don't do thatâ€¦I'm pretty sure I'll enjoy doing those things when I can't drive."</note></figure>
