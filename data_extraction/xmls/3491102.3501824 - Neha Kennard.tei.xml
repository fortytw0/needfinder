<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research on menstrual tracking has emphasized the need for more inclusive design of mechanisms for tracking and sharing information on menstruation. We investigate menstrual tracking and data-sharing attitudes and practices in educated, young (20-30 years old) menstruating individuals based in the United States, with self-identifed minimal menstrual education backgrounds. Using interviews (N=18), a survey (N=62), and participatory design (N=7), we fnd that existing mechanisms for tracking and sharing data on menstruation are not adequately responsive to the needs of those who seek relevant menstrual education, are not in the sexual majority, and/or wish to customize what menstrual data they share and with whom. Our analysis highlights a design gap for participants with minimal sexual education backgrounds who wish to better understand their cycles. We also contribute a deepened understanding of structural health inequities that impact menstrual tracking and sharing practices, making recommendations for technology-mediated menstrual care.</p></div>

As overall menstrual health and hygiene management as well as datafcation of health receive growing attention from our research community (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>), technology-mediated menstrual tracking options have garnered interest. Increasingly, many smartphone applications are being designed for predicting the length and frequency of one's menstrual cycle and fertility windows <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref> based on information actively recorded by the user, such as period dates, sexual activity, medication usage, and more. Multiple studies have evaluated these applications and presented design gaps such as prediction inaccuracy, gendered design, goal exclusionary frameworks, and lack in promoting menstrual literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">101]</ref>. Fox et al. have explored future menstrual tracking designs using participatory design methods and provided many high-level user concerns (e.g. assumptions about tracking goals, gender identity, and sexual partners) that further motivate our research <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>.</p><p>Our research elaborates on previous fndings on inclusive menstrual tracking design and investigates data sharing methods to provide further insight into current users' aspirations for future design of menstrual tracking technologies. In addition, we draw on previous work on cultural responsiveness in HCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref> and work on health inequities' roots in societal structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82]</ref> to discuss how the participants' cultural backgrounds (e.g., access to menstrual health education and care, menstrual stigma at school and home, income, and education level) might impact the mechanisms they use for menstrual tracking. As a result, we examine our fndings through the culturally disparate backgrounds and relatively conservative upbringings of the participants.</p><p>Our mixed-method approach entailed frst investigating menstrual tracking and sharing practices via a survey of 62 people. We then conducted 18 semi-structured interviews and a participatory design (PD) activity with 7 participants to explore future design directions. All participants from the interviews and PD activity were college-educated menstruating individuals with minimal menstrual education backgrounds, minimal access to menstrual health care, and often grew up in homes with menstrual stigma. We found that current tracking systems fail to account for those who come from low menstrual health education backgrounds. In addition, individuals who face menstrual stigma at home wanted fexibility in how they shared their logged data-both in terms of who could see the data and how much data was shared. We also saw that people, especially those who were unwilling to seek out medical professionals in case of an irregularity, desired ways of visualizing and interpreting their logged data as it pertained to their menstrual wellbeing. We found that for those who wish to improve their menstrual literacy, resources for culturally responsive menstrual education at home is a high priority. We conclude with recommendations for the design of technological solutions that might easily be integrated into menstruating individuals' daily routines, aford cross-platform use, and begin to address potential menstrual health inequity gaps.</p><p>In this paper, we begin by detailing related work that has been conducted on menstruation in HCI, detail our mixed-methods approach towards addressing menstrual tracking design, and present our main fndings drawn from triangulating across our analyses. We then discuss implications of these fndings in terms of menstrual tracking needs and aspirations, and suggest recommendations for future designs. We conclude with a summary of the study with suggestions for future work in this space. Our contributions are three-fold: frst, we expand on prior work on gaps in menstrual tracking design through the cultural contexts of the participants, such as how menstrual health is addressed within a participant's home and/or school; second, we uncover how tracking practices are shaped on account of minimal menstrual education; fnally, we provide insights for designing culturally responsive menstrual tracking solutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>HCI is a multi-disciplinary feld that has increasingly involved social discussion and design implications. As more and more stakeholders are engaged with, health and gender have also recently been examined through sociotechnical lens. Fields, such as Feminist HCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>, motivate the area of research as not only explorations to "represent human diversity", but also a "shift in social science knowledge production away from managing people to nurturing them. " Still, as the feld matures additional shifts are still occurring such as movements away from research reinforcing "universalised, singular experience of womanhoods" <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref>.</p><p>Gendered health and wellbeing in recent years have seen work on a range of topics in this area, such as maternal and reproductive health, digital wellbeing, health hackathons, and more (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>). This research has aimed at critiquing and developing technologies that help support pregnancy, motherhood, and childhood development <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref>, also pointing out the lack of technology eforts targeting gendered wellbeing more generally <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>. More recently however, HCI has seen an expansion to a plethora of gendered health topics, including social impact, menstrual health and tracking, and menopause (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91]</ref>). Related recent work has also examined design opportunities targeting gendered sexual wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">41]</ref>, intimate care <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100]</ref>, mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>, and menopause <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">93]</ref>, among other topics <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">47]</ref>.</p><p>Prior research has examined the relationship between menstrual health and hygiene from a range of perspectives, from an indication of needs to a fundamental human right <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77]</ref>. In addition to menstrual health, menstrual tracking intersects with the vast feld of health informatics that analyzes insights and provides design guidance to help people track, understand, and share personal health data such as migraines <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, habits <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>, and others (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84]</ref>). In work on analyzing inclusive menstrual tracking practices, Epstein et al. studied the usage pattern of tracking application across the United States and identifed several design problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref> in line with previous work that also focused on the usability problem of menstrual tracking applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>. Fox et al., through participatory design, examined high-level user concerns about sharing, uncertainty, period prediction, and accidental periods <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>. Apart from software-based self-logging solutions such as smartphone applications, some recently developed wearable devices such as my.Flow [2] and LOONCUP <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> use embedded sensors to automatically detect menstrual fow volume, color and cycle lengths. Researchers have also studied how ambient light and color-emitting mirrors can be used for menstrual tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">34]</ref>. Additional research has investigated self-tracking within diferent gendered health contexts, such as fertility care <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>, sensitive data management <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>, and menopause/menopausal transition <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89]</ref>, contributing design implications such as creating personalized solutions through collaboration and exploring automated sensing solutions and smart spaces.</p><p>In gendered health, Keyes et al. illustrate that although research so far does well with articulating embodiment and gender, prior work often overlooks trans, disabled, and non-western perspectives as well as intersections of race, class, sexuality, and cultural contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref>. At the intersection of menstrual health, HCI, and cultural contexts, much prior work has looked at communities in South Asia. For example, Tuli et al. have explored menstrual health education and stigma in India through culturally responsive design <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref>. Jarrahi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref> did a comparative study on the efect of menstrual health education approaches for adolescent individuals who menstruate and found the peer group method as most efective in promoting menstrual health behaviors in adolescents. Jain et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref> have created a solution for adolescent menstruators in Assam, India to seek support through a tablet-based game <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref>. Outside of the South Asian context, Tran et al. designed a menstrual toy to help educate children on menstruation concepts at an early age. Labella <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref> was created by Almeida et al. to promote self-understanding, exploration, and taboo-breaking.</p><p>Similarly, in our paper, we examine how an individual's background impacts their view on a potential health-solution. We turn to Salgado et al. who points out that all people involved in a design or evaluation process have their own cultural characteristics that can bias their understanding and interpretation of a product <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. From a user experience perspective, the holistic design approach recognizes that designs require a balance between usability, functionality, aesthetics, and stakeholders' cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">50]</ref>. To determine what cultural information about a specifc community is relevant, the human values approach proposes that the family, social relations, economic system, and environment in which people live is closely connected to what people deem important and of value <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>.</p><p>By looking at a participant's cultural information, we also hope to contribute an understanding of societal origins of potential health and health disparities <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref> in current menstrual tracking methods. In a systematic review of mobile health interventions, <ref type="bibr">Stowell et al.</ref> found that many studies have examined the role of mobile applications, wearable trackers, and other mechanisms for promoting health generally, but little work has been done to determine how these solutions can be best designed for vulnerable populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. Veinot et al. fnd that many health informatics interventions are biased towards socioeconomically advantaged groups, thus increasing the risk of producing intervention-generated inequalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>.</p><p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute reports that inequities in health have their roots in societal structures such as an individual's social class, racial ethnic background, and other dimensions of social stratifcation (e.g., sex and geography) <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>. For example, Bui et al. suggest gender inequities perceived by female undergraduate students in southern Vietnamese culture infuence their sexual and reproductive health, especially in regards to health information seeking, gynecological care access, contraceptive use responsibility, and child bearing <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>. Kaufman fnds that poor reproductive health care service seeking was directly related to underinvestment, health inequities, and lack of reproductive health education in Chinese villages <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>. Many more studies around the world fnd that inequitable concentrations of economic, social, personal, and political power reinforces both reproductive health-seeking and reproductive health care providing biases that can be detrimental to the patient <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">95]</ref>. Our study takes place in the United States, where menstrual stigma is generally less limiting than prior studied contexts in the Global South, for example (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91]</ref>). However, the participants from our study came from culturally disparate backgrounds with minimal menstrual education, signaling a U.S. demographic with health needs that may warrant greater attention in future work. Previous work done in the U.S. have primarily highlighted racial ethnic background, economic status, and sexual minority status as major societal structures for sexual health inequity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">98]</ref>.</p><p>With these purposes in mind, we expand on studies and evaluations done on current menstrual tracking solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">101]</ref> as well as critiques on the reinforcement of "normalized" user characteristics such as gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>, body type <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78]</ref>, or age in technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref> by detailing the areas in which current menstrual designs are lacking and design suggestions for future solutions that are culturally responsive of various menstruating groups. We examine our fndings in the contexts of the participants' families, school, peers, environment and to a lesser degree, education and income, and how these cultural contexts impact their opinions on menstrual health matters. In doing so, we address menstrual health inequities that may stem from such backgrounds. We then discuss the implications these backgrounds have on menstrual tracking designs. We adopt Bardzell's Feminist HCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref> standpoint with regards to our methodological positions of empathetic relationships, co-construction, and refexivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. In our studies, we aim to make the "individual an active participant, and them taking action is at the fore of our quest to design systems that promote agency, autonomy, and knowledge" <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>. In doing so, we take our cue from the works published in the ACM TOCHI special issue on the body pushing us to re-imagine approaches to engaging in culturally responsive design <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">47]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHODS</head><p>We employed a mixed-methods approach-approved by the institutional review board (IRB) at our institution-using a survey, interviews, and participatory design (PD) to gain a deeper understanding of current menstrual tracking design limitations and explore the aspirations the participants in our study had for future menstrual tracking designs. We frst conducted a survey of 62 individuals to gather how adults across ages viewed current menstrual tracking cultural responsiveness and what themes we could explore further in our interviews. We then conducted 18 interviews with participants who have had minimal menstrual education growing up. Finally, drawing from these interviews and taking notes from feminist HCI methodologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>, such as co-construction of core research questions and understanding participants' experiences through empathic relationships, we conducted a PD (n=7) session to better understand current menstrual tracking practices and considerations for those practices, and to also discover desires that participants with low menstrual literacy had to improve menstrual tracking methods. Participants who took the survey were distinct from the ones who we interviewed and conducted the PD session with. However, there was an overlap of 3 participants who, after being interviewed, expressed interest in participating in future workshops. They were invited back to participate in the PD session. For each method used, we provide details on the participants, the types of data collected, and how we analyzed this data to arrive at our analysis. We quote survey responses with SXX, interviews with IXX, and participatory design quotes with DX.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Method 1: Survey</head><p>We designed an in-depth survey targeting adults who menstruate, to understand how these adults perceived cultural responsiveness and informativeness of current menstrual tracking methods. We included 39 questions, with 6 questions targeting those who had or have menstrual experiences, 14 targeting those who have tracked their menstrual cycles, 8 targeting those who have never tracked their menstrual cycles, 7 focused on opinions on sharing menstrual data, and 4 focused on demographics. We included both open-and closed-format questions with diferent answering formats. For example, some questions were multiple choice, asking about the participant's current menstrual experience (e.g., irregular cycles, use of birth control, perimenopause). Some were Likert scale questions such as the degree to which a participant's current tracking method served certain purposes. Some were more openended such as questions on what characteristics seemed to make a participant's menstrual cycle irregular. Others were questions with multiple answer choices such as symptoms tracked by the participant.</p><p>We recruited survey participants through university and authors' social network email chains, WhatsApp, Facebook, Reddit forums such as r/SampleSize, and Slack workspaces. Online crowdsourcing platforms such as r/SampleSize have been reported as a potential recruitment tools for diverse participant pools <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. Studies have shown that participants recruited from such platforms usually report diverse ages, education levels, income, and employment, were inexpensive, and are often internally motivated to participate in user research <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. For these reasons, we decided to disseminate  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Of the 7 participants who identifed themselves as male, one experienced menstruation and tracked their cycle, while the other six made up the non-menstruating individuals in our survey. These six identifed themselves as partners or friends to menstruators.</p><p>We calculated percentages for all questions except the openended ones. For open-ended questions, we conducted thematic analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref> through frst coding responses from diferent stakeholders. These codes were then clustered into common themes and patterns through the process of afnity diagramming <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref>. Themes that came up repeatedly were "track using phone application", "wanting to know more about my body", "sharing data with others", "motivation to track", or "need for more education".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Method 2: Interviews</head><p>On analyzing the survey responses, we identifed several areas we wanted to explore further, including motivations behind tracking or non-tracking, how menstrual tracking data is shared with others, and the pain points of current tracking methods. From the survey demographics, we also observed a prevalence of higher-ed individuals with menstrual cycles between the ages of 20 and 30 who grew up in environments with minimal access to menstrual education. Minimal access entailed having only taken one sexual and/or menstrual health class or less. For those that had taken sexual and/or menstrual health classes before, they expressed that the classes did not prepare them for their frst period and/or their future menstrual cycles. With this group in mind, we designed and conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with individuals with a menstrual cycle who were raised in areas where sexual-conservatism is prevalent such as "Deep South" America, China and India, and were pursuing or have a higher-ed degree. We screened participants through the same self-reported minimal sexual education characteristics as the survey. For example, we asked potential participants the amount of menstrual education they had received, how prepared they felt for their frst period and/or future menstrual cycles, and their perception of their own menstrual health knowledge level. We interviewed those who had minimal to no menstrual health education prior to menarche, felt unprepared for menarche and/or future cycles, and perceived themselves as having minimal menstrual education. Each interview was conducted by one researcher via phone or desktop online meeting platform such as Zoom or BlueJeans. During each interview, the researcher would lead the interview and ask followup questions when necessary. Interviews lasted about 30 minutes and the audios were recorded. Participants were recruited through the authors' social networks using a combination of purposive and snowball sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>.</p><p>Of the 18 interviewees, all but 4 are currently tracking their periods on a mobile device either through applications (e.g. Clue, Apple Health, Period Tracker, Flo, FitBit, P Tracker Lite), phone calendar, and/or text history. Of the four who do not currently track, two always had their period on the same date, with a margin of error of a day, one became consistent in date after a few years who has also never tracked, and one has no period consistency because of her type of birth control but used to track before. In addition, 9 participants identifed as having irregular periods and all have gone through a span of time in which their period became irregular for more than 3 months.</p><p>We analyzed interview data by open coding interviews line by line. We then used afnity diagramming <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref> to cluster similar patterns with these codes. Through our thematic analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>, we discovered common themes such as "minimal sexual education", "frst menstrual health struggles", "dealing with uncertainty", "support seeking sharing", and "personalization. "</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Method 3: Participatory Design</head><p>Drawing from the interviews and following Feminist HCI framework in involving people with menstrual cycles as active actors in design processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>, we conducted a participatory design (PD) workshop with 7 current menstrual trackers. The participants were recruited through the authors' social networks using a combination of purposive and snowball sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>, who were also from minimal menstrual education backgrounds pursuing a higher-education degree. Our goal was to better understand participants' perceptions and attitudes towards menstrual cycle tracking and derive feature sets that were considered of high importance.</p><p>The activity was conducted on the Georgia Institute of Technology campus with all researchers present. One researcher led the workshop, while the others took observational notes of the participants. At the beginning of the workshop, we explained the study protocol and obtained written consent from all participants. All data was recorded using feld notes and photographs.</p><p>For the PD activity, we encouraged the participants to develop their ideal version of what a "magical" menstrual tracker would do for them. Following loosely Spinuzzi's 3-stage process for participatory design research <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref> as well as Bardzell's principle for building empathic relationship with participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>, we frst had participants introduce and familiarize themselves with each other, researchers, and the meeting space. Then, we entered a discovery stage in which researchers and participants worked to understand menstrual values, goals, and challenges. Finally, the participants worked together to prototype technologies for future menstrual experiences.</p><p>The participants created two tools that they would want that tracked their periods perfectly regardless of whether the technology was feasible or not. The creation process included writing out pain points they would like to address, drawing out scenarios they would use the technology in, and sketching out what the technology might look like. During the PD, the participants came up with two main solutions for their "magical and/or perfect" tracker: a colorchanging calendar that was incorporated into their (bathroom) mirrors and a wearable smart watch with physiological sensors that collected data that could be visualized as trends and relationships seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>.</p><p>We used participant's sketches and designs, open coded transcribed discussions, and open coded feld notes to refect on the design process and describe the fnal design ideas.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Limitations</head><p>As HCI researchers seeking information on menstrual tracking opinions and current usage, our methods were biased toward not only menstrual trackers but also menstrual trackers using technology. Only 17.9% of the survey participants and 16.7% of the interviewees had never tracked their menstrual cycle before. Out of the surveyed trackers, only 23% of them do not use technology to track their periods while all interview trackers used technology to track. Thus, the data may not be representative for populations who do not track or do not use technology to track. However, from the survey open responses and interviews, we do glean some insight into circumstances that might lead a user to stop tracking, such as changes in life stages or loss of motivation. In addition, another limitation of the study is the lack of racial, age, and gender diversity. Although we sampled for any US adult in the survey and any menstruating US adult in the interviews and PD activity, the participants from all three methods skewed towards young (20-30 yrs), identifed as female, college-educated, industrialized, and Caucasian and Asian/Pacifc Islander. Future work should be done to expand our fndings to diferent education backgrounds, economic statuses, racial ethnic backgrounds, age-groups, sexual minorities, accesses to technology, and other groups underrepresented in our study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">FINDINGS</head><p>In the following section, we detail six main fndings extracted from our mixed-methods approach. These include: a lack of culturally responsive functionality for multiple marginalized groups beyond gender and embodiment; a demand for visualizing and putting data in context as it pertains to menstrual health; a distinction between pro-social and non-social sharing practices; the impact of limited menstrual health education, existing both in participants' backgrounds and in tracking methods; addressing feelings of uncertainty in menstrual tracking; and aspirations for future methods such as appeals for increased mobility and access within technological solutions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Lack of Culturally Responsive Design for Marginalized Groups</head><p>Expanding Epstein et al. fndings <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>, around half of the menstrual trackers we surveyed felt that their app was less than adequate in providing culturally responsive functionality in all of the following categories: diferent age groups, impairments, race/nationalities, sexual orientation, and illnesses relating to gendered health. Around 40% of the survey takers thought that their current tracking method was less than adequate in diferent life stage inclusively (i.e. pregnancy, perimenopause, menopause, birth control). Amongst the few people who were entering, experiencing, or have experienced menopause, all of them noted that they stopped using their previous, usually long-term (around 10+ years), tracking method because the functionalities were no longer useful. One participant stopped tracking during her pregnancy and was surprised to see her application had factored the 9-month period-break into its period prediction algorithm when she started her normal menstrual cycle again (S55). Those who self-diagnosed themselves with natural or chemically induced irregular periods, such as with birth control, also voiced similar woes. Irregular periods are characterized by any abnormalities in the rhythm of a menstrual cycle and hormonal fuctuations <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref> that usually encapsulates extreme deviance from "normal" timing and fow. As the participants were not medically-diagnosed with irregular cycles, the participants also acknowledged that their lack of menstrual knowledge could impact how they view their cycle as abnormal. P12 expressed her transition from tracking religiously to not tracking at all because her application assumed regular period behavior. She felt no motivation to track when the application could  While reinforcing "the idea of a universalised, singular experience of womanhood" <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref>, current menstrual tracking methods fail to address the needs of those in marginalized groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Data in Menstrual Health Context</head><p>In logging their symptoms, the participants held an expectation that they would be able to discern abnormalities when going back through their historical logs. This expectation often did not hold true. Approximately 70% of the survey takers tracked menstrual characteristics besides just dates and timing. Most of the period tracking interviewees tracked at least blood fow and major symptoms. We observed a demand to log symptoms in both groups; however, none of the interviewees expressed that they had extracted any defnitive information about their menstrual symptoms from the application due to issues including tracking method, data clarity, non-existent representation of trends, or non-existent summary of historical data. P16 expressed how she has always entered every symptom she experiences right before, during, and after her period. However, when she reviews past data, she cannot discern what is abnormal or normal. She elaborates that she feels especially frustrated with her period fow. To this day, she does not know if she has a regular fow or not and she did not remember ever learning how to discern from her community or school either. Clicking through logs from previous months just confuses her more because she does not know if there are consistencies when she's comparing one day's data at a time. In addition, we noticed that there seems to exist a discrepancy between how menstrual applications are designed and advertised and how they end up being used by the participants. The research participants track for a myriad of reasons (i.e. pregnancy, hormones, medical reasons), but by far the most popular (89%) reason is to know when their period occurs. In comparison, only 17% of trackers went into menstrual tracking for reasons besides dates and timing. However, a large percentage of users started tracking other menstrual characteristics once they started tracking, such as period fow (56%), appearance changes like bloating and acne (33%), and fertility windows (25%). Once they start tracking, the percentage of users who track menstrual characteristics beyond dates and timing increases to 70%. Both trackers in our interviews and PD brought up stories about how they had heard about tracking as only a way to keep track of dates be it from their friends, family, or online. "I regret not tracking earlier because now I do it religiously for my health and it gives me comfort. But in the past, I thought menstrual tracking was only for dates and people said the prediction was really bad so I just never cared to check it out. Even when I opened the application for the frst time, it took me a second to fnd that I could track more than just my period date. " (P15)</p><p>For the interview participants that have tracked before, they expressed very diferent concerns about current tracking solutions compared to the two participants who have never tracked. We found that the trackers were more concerned about how their logged data related to each other, checking their logging history, next period predictions, and user experience. On the other hand, participants who have never tracked saw tracking only as a means to predict their next period. They did not feel a need to do so when they felt like they could predict their next period. While the trackers tended to note down more than one symptom, such as pain, craving, fow, and mood, the non-trackers had a inclination towards keeping mental notes of one physical symptom that seemed to dominate over other symptoms they might have noticed. In all three cases, this symptom was menstrual cramps. "I don't track because my timing was never unexpected. So I never felt the need to track... My life is very routine so nothing really changes. I do take careful notice what causes my cramps. " (P11)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Distinction Between Pro-social vs Non-social sharing</head><p>Around 54% of the survey participants said they would like to or have tracked a friend's menstrual data; with 50% indicating their signifcant other or sexual partner, and 15% their child. Of the nonself-trackers, 30.8% said that they use a phone application to track others. In the same group, 39% said they track others to understand the person they are tracking's emotional changes better, 31% said to educate the person they are tracking, and 30.8% said to understand the person they are tracking health better. These results are not exclusive to one another.</p><p>Many of the interview participants also share their menstrual cycle information, with close ones, or for health, whether to bond with other menstruating individuals, or to inform their doctor. P6 is a tracker who uses her chat history with her mother as a a means to check when she had her last period. However, all of the participants had mixed feelings about who they would share their menstrual tracking information. While sharing would enable the other side to empathize with and provide care, sharing might also be a form of "unwarranted control over their bodies" or embarrassing and uncomfortable.</p><p>"I got mad to my dad and big brother. They say oh she's on her period. They just assume she's on her period. I prefer they don't ask. I don't want them to know when I am on my period even if I don't say anything. I am shy and I don't feel comfortable. It's weird. My boyfriend will know because he can get emotionally prepared, get sweets, and take care of me. " (P13) Even for the PD participants who designed sharing capabilities into their "magical" tracker put restrictions on sharing. For their mirror solution, the participants expressed needs for privacy and password protection. Their wearable solution could not stand on its own and relied on outside technology such as a phone application for data interpretation. However, none of the participants were adverse to having multiple technology sources working as a whole solution for menstrual tracking, rather they encouraged data fuidity between devices for ease of access: "I feel like I would only want to send part of my calendar; I don't want other people to know everything. " (D3).</p><p>From all three methods, we found that the participants have both pro-social and non-social menstrual data sharing opinions. None of the participants were open to the idea of sharing their period information with everyone, but none wanted to only keep period information to themselves always. Common sharing customs included: telling their friends if they were on their period, complaining to any empathetic ear if a symptom was particularly intense, telling their signifcant other so their signifcant other could take care of them, and not telling their guardians or relatives be it about symptoms or dates because this disclosure would sometimes be uncomfortable.</p><p>When discussing potential designs, P13 expressed how nice it would be if her boyfriend could track with her sometimes. She was tired of reminding him every cycle especially when she was already in a bad mood. On the other hand, D4 made a point to include a password on the smart menstrual tracking mirror so that her father would not be able to view her menstrual data.</p><p>"One worry is Roommates can come into my room and look at my info, I don't want that...If I am going on a vacation with the girls, I would want to sync up our calendars...For my family, I feel like I would only want to send part of my calendar; I don't want them to know everything. " (D1) Lin et. al.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">The Impact of Limited Menstrual Health Education</head><p>While 83% of the participants felt that their tracking method provided them adequate or more accurate prediction, with similar high ratings for tracking all that they wanted to track, the organization and clarity of the method, and comfort of the method, 48% felt that their current tracking method did not give any informative advice about their menstrual health and 50% felt the same way about general menstrual health education. These sentiments were also articulated by the interview and PD participants who expressed woes over not being provided adequate menstrual preparation growing up and even now as they track their periods. interview and PD participants came from a self-identifed "minimal sexual health education background. " Many of the participants cited not only a lack of educational but also parental/guardian support, especially for their frst period as well as conveying traumatic experiences from their frst periods. P16 shared a story about how the frst time she used a tampon, her mother had not told her how to use it, so she had inserted the applicator and the tampon together and was in pain for hours: "When I got my frst period, I thought I was dying. " (P15).</p><p>We found that often when the participant comes from a minimal menstrual education background, their guardians often did as well. 11 of the interviewees expressed that their mothers came from conservative, low menstrual health backgrounds which contributed to minimal menstrual conversations. A common distinction between the participants and their guardians, however, was the openness of period talk. The were more likely than their parents at the same age to mention their cycles to guardians at some point of their lives as well as discuss it amongst their friends. However, multiple participants discussed how their guardians grew up in environments where periods were not talked about in schools or amongst guardians and was heavily shameful and stigmatized. Almost all of the Asian participants' mothers were a part of this category.</p><p>"Sometimes she would talk about it, it would be a little awkward. She had to whisper about it. I felt awkward from her whispering about it. I don't see why we had to whisper about it, why can't she be direct. My mom grew up in a small town and for her it was a bit taboo and not frequently talked about. If it was, it was in hushed tones. Deep South (United States), middle of nowhere, was where she grew up. I think my opinion didn't mirror hers later on because I grew up around girls who talked about it in a non-taboo way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>" (P16)</head><p>There also seemed to be a diference between the frst period experiences for those that had involved guardians and those who had guardians who did not have conversations with their child about menstrual health beforehand. The participants who did not have conversations with their guardians beforehand expressed feelings of great uncertainty, thoughts of them being abnormal, and were less likely to reach out to their guardians on their frst period. Multiple of these interviewees thought of their frst time periods as traumatic and thought that something was drastically wrong with them. Participants who had guardian support, on the other hand, panicked less and sought information from their guardians. These participants often started tracking earlier (1-2 yrs) as well.</p><p>"My mom used to track for me when I frst got it. I think maybe for the frst two or three? This helped me start tracking. " (P3) However, the participants were not ignorant to their own minimal menstrual education backgrounds. On the contrary, they wanted easier access to resources for themselves and peers. While viewing current access to menstrual health professionals from where they grew up as mostly expensive and far away, all of the PD participants mentioned a need to include readily-available menstrual health education sources in both of their design solutions. For the mirror, they proposed integrating information sharing with medical professionals as well as health tips that would pop up when entered symptoms that were abnormal from previous data. For the wearable, they proposed a companion application that had forums with discussions and Q&amp;A's between other menstruating users on the topic of menstrual health. The participants expressed how talking to other individuals in the past who have gone through similar menstrual experiences was both informative and also mentally assuring that they were not alone.</p><p>"There used to be this website where you can go...if you're having a breakdown and talk to someone to calm you down. I wish I had that for periods. " (D2)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Addressing Feelings of Uncertainty in Menstrual Tracking</head><p>In dealing with their menstrual cycle, the interview participants go to great lengths to feel a sense of control over their periods while simultaneously feeling that many aspects of their period are out of their control. Many (n=10) of the interview participants feel the least amount of control around period timing as well as symptoms. Common feelings expressed by them about their cycles were "powerless", "uncontrollable", and "unpredictable." P1, P11, P12, and P15 shared specifc sentiments that when their periods are irregular they felt discomfort both physically and mentally.</p><p>"I always had to be prepared. It was such an inconvenience when you don't know when it'll come. If I get surprised, I felt like I had to prepare for the worst." (P15)</p><p>As a result, following "old-wives" tales, seeking out information, and tracking often became both assurance and an attempt to feel control. Following hearsay advice was a common approach the Asian participants took to try and alleviate their symptoms, even if results were inconsistent across cycles, such as "not drinking cold water your period" and "drinking ginger tea to start their period. " However, this lack of consistency did not bother the participants and instead gave them comfort that they made an attempt. "At least I tried this time and if it does not work, I can try something else next time" was a common view held by these participants. This penchant for "next time" provided enough security for them to not to feel powerless in both cases of following hearsay as well as searching for their symptoms online. The non-Asian participants expressed hearing fewer "old-wives" tales growing up than the Asian counterparts. In further questioning, the Asian participants cited their mothers as the main source of these advice and also noted that their mothers also came from minimal menstrual education backgrounds.</p><p>Finding information usually entailed typing symptom causes into a search engine and rarely fnding a medical professional (n=1). All of the interview participants had used a search engine to look up their symptoms. In all cases, they have searched the exact same questions again during a later cycle because the frst search did not provide satisfactory answers. However, this failure did not reportedly create more anxiety but instead facilitated a self-assurance process. P17 when prompted about why she felt assurance even after not fnding any answers to her symptoms realized that every answer she's ever sought out was so vague that she left feeling like she had to tell herself that everything is probably alright so she does not get anxious. She also expressed a tiny hope that the next time she searches the same thing again, she will get fruitful answers. In the same prompt, she also reached an epiphany that she does not actually know if she has a regular period or not because she did not know what "regular" actually meant. She had just assumed she was regular because she never felt intense cramps.</p><p>Similarly, tracking has rarely given the participants additional information that they did not already know, yet they are comforted by entering data alone. Although these participants were more likely to be more in tune with their bodies such as being able to recall their last period faster as well as more symptoms than nontrackers, they rarely observed trends or idiosyncratic characteristics within their bodies via their tracking method. This observation follows the additional fnding that the participants have a hard time understanding the relationship between their tracked data and their menstrual health status. P12 conveyed how she used to track everything including her period, but only when she presented her tracked data to a medical professional did she know that she had a menstrual health problem. No matter how she looked at the data, she was unable to discern any concerns from the symptoms or dates that she entered. However, she never felt anything was wrong and happily entered her period symptoms each month as she felt like it would give her clarity one day. Like her, tracking for many became their largest source for feelings of control over their period. As P2 put it, "Tracking feels like more control over something uncontrollable. " "I track a lot about my heath: workout, illness, sometimes food and water intake. Mentally, it makes me feel in control. It actually gives me clarity. I like being self-aware. " (P12) However, how the feeling of self-control translates to self-awareness has yet to be established.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Aspirations for Future Technological Solutions</head><p>Around 77% of the survey trackers (n=40), 78% of the interviewees (n=14), and all PD participants use their mobile phones to track their periods. Many cited the phone's mobile and reminder abilities for using their phone to track. "I tried using a little calendar that my school gave to me when I was younger but it was too much to keep up with/log so I just downloaded an app" (S27). However, participants from all three methods talked about how pulling out their phones to log their timing or symptoms was a hassle and sometimes if they were busy, they would easily forget to log altogether. With these pain-points in mind, the PD participants created their two main solutions: the smart mirror and the wearable. Both solutions emphasized tracked data displayed in a visual way for fast access as well as on "easy incorporation" into routine life. In addition, both solutions required a quick way to peruse menstrual history and extract trends from the color-coded calendar based on symptoms and dates to the data visualization compilations done of medical data. Neither solution was concerned with collecting too much The participants viewed the smart mirror as more easily accessible by unwanted parties in comparison to privacy aforded by the wearable.</p><p>During the PD, we found that the participants had a strong inclination toward automating the menstrual tracking process in a way that could fow naturally into an individual's daily routine. More specifcally, participants desired a design that is portable, easy to integrate into their preexisting schedules, readily adoptable, does not involve intrusive sensors, and operable on multiple platforms (e.g., a wearable and an accompanying app). Although we did not ask the interviewees or respondents about designs they would like to see, the ease of logging sentiments in ubiquitous solutions were not unmentioned. P11, who has never found appeal in tracking before, shared how if her home assistant (e.g., Alexa) asked her for logging information and sent that data to her phone, she would start logging. In addition, she has considered wearables-especially smart watches-for potential ease of logging but has not gotten a smartwatch for fnancial reasons.</p><p>Easy integration amongst the participants encapsulated two designs: one that was ubiquitous to their lifestyle and one that could be paired with existing technology while still standing alone. Common themes around logging menstrual symptoms that came up were about forgetfulness, inconvenience, and anxiety. To mediate these feelings, the participants' solution was to create a tracker that they had to use not only on a period-basis but also a daily-basis such as a mirror. my phone, I always forget to put in information for certain days and I don't realize I forget till the end of the week. I wish there was a way to make me put in tracking stuf easier or forced me to do it kind of like taking blood, like in the morning when you have to prick yourself. " (D3)</p><p>The other integration across devices had to with the participants wanting to view data in diferent ways and serving diferent functions. For example, how they log their data and how they interpret their data did not need to be on the same device. D1 shared how her current smartwatch has health logging and she would like that data to feed into applications such as her period tracking application so that she could analyze all of her health data as it pertains to her menstrual health.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head><p>As more devices and platforms are introduced for self-measuring and monitoring one's bodily activities and functions, self-tracking and self-care practices are becoming more and more prevalent <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.</p><p>Lin et. al.</p><p>In an efort to improve their lives, users log data to better understand themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref>, and menstrual tracking is no exception <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>. Although self-surveillance practices have been shown to help people feel more control and help them achieve personal goals, current designs for menstrual tracking have not only failed to rectify its limited defnitions of sexual, menstrual, and reproductive health, but have also continued to "perpetuate normative stereotypes and assumptions about people as sexual and reproductive subjects" <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>. While evaluating these self-tracking methods and addressing the impact the participants' cultural characteristics might have on their understanding of their method <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>, we found no exception to the above statement in our work. We expand on how the environments and values <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref> of the users informed their tracking needs and how they gave meaning to their tracking methods. We also call out gaps that current users have with existing trackers, and we provide suggestions for more culturally responsive designs, especially from a lens of those with minimal health background. In addition, while we fnd implications specifc to those who are from conservative, minimal menstrual education backgrounds, we fnd minimal divergences across the represented cultural groups in our study. In our discussion, we aim to follow Bardzell's refexivity feminist HCI principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>. We put forth implications to not only potentially improve the menstrual tracking experience, but also elaborate on the structures that reinforce inconsistent functionality for marginalized communities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Cultural Context Inclusivity</head><p>Multiple evaluations have found that current menstrual tracking methods fail to culturally responsively design for individuals who do not have regular menstrual cycles, individuals who are seeking accurate menstrual education, as well as individuals who share their menstrual data with anyone but their potential male signifcant other <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">101]</ref>.</p><p>Like in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>, we found that the participants were concerned over the dearth of functionalities provided for those that are not in the sexual majority: regular periods with singular tracking purposes. This absence of support is especially prevalent for groups who have self-reported irregular periods, are taking birth control, are entering into a diferent life stage such as pregnancy, or transitioning into being or not being a menstruator (e.g. travel, stress). In our study we found that the above groups are not only aware of the design disparities against themselves but across other minorities as well. The participants expressed the existence of multiple design failures across diferent age groups, impairments, race/nationalities, sexual orientation and illnesses relating to menstrual health. Some of these feelings are supported by studies that have found that very few menstrual tracking methods address needs of patients struggling with infertility <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[101]</ref> and sexual orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref> if at all. Furthermore, we found that many current menstrual tracking methods do not account for an individual's menstrual educational background or provide means to pursue one. In Eschler et. al. evaluation of menstrual tracking applications, they found that their sample of applications had insufcient support for aiding or promoting menstrual literacy, especially for teen and perimenopausal users <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>. This gap is especially amongst the participants who neither gathered menstrual knowledge from their schools, guardians, or tracking method and were often experiencing selfreported menstrual irregularities not voiced by their peers. In addition, many of these same participants also grew up under guardians who also came from backgrounds of minimal menstrual health literacy and heavy menstrual stigma. The participants' teen experiences with periods, similar to those in previous menstrual health inequity studies in Asia <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">46]</ref>, were often traumatic and seeking out help was usually faced with feelings of shame and taboo. The participants over time sought out menstrual educational information even if it rarely included seeking out medical help. In our study, they highlight a need for their own tracking method to be a facilitator in menstrual literacy and to include designs that would enable them to educate themselves on their bodies.</p><p>In Kwak et al.'s work, irregular menstruation appeared to be associated with socioeconomic status, especially in terms of education and household income <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref>. They found a tendency of low educational levels or highest quartile of household incomes to be at the highest risk for irregular menstrual cycles. The participants were largely drawn from medium-high afuent and educated menstruators, a population not found to have signifcantly high odds for irregular periods <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref>. Yet, the proportion of the interview participants who self-reported irregular cycles ( 50%) was signifcantly higher than the U.S. average for individuals with irregular menstrual cycles of the similar age group (14%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. The main factors that contributed to the higher likelihood of menstruation irregularity in the Kwak et al. study within high household income menstruators were job-related stress, physical and mental fatigue, irregular life patterns, dietary changes, and sleep deprivation. The reinforcement of mental and social resources such as social support and sense of control <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> were cited as contributors to higher education's relationship to long-term health. The participants not only expressed similar afictions to those of high household income mesntruators in Kwak et al. 's study <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref>, but also lacked both mental and social resources such as guardian support and access to sexual education <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Their upbringing could explain why the percentage of the interview participants with self-reported irregular cycles was so high.</p><p>On the other hand, we note that the participants self-diagnosed their cycles as "irregular" and did not seek out a medical prognosis. There could exist discrepancies between how they defned menstrual irregularity and how the medical community defnes abnormalities. This gap in understanding what constitutes an "irregular" period may indicate additional hurdles users like the participants may face in getting to understand their bodies. Carey et al. notes that understanding health, especially in Western biomedical contexts, commonly places an emphasis on the individual as maker of "healthy" or "poor health" choices but not enough on the world segment that they share <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>. These gaps in understanding could be the result of an amalgam of societal structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> that produce negative feedback loop of individuals not seeking out health aid but if they do, they are not provided with adequate support (e.g. relevant menstrual education).</p><p>Another design consideration that current tracking methods have rarely incorporated, much less segregated based on selectivity, is menstrual data sharing. Glow, a menstrual tracking application, CHI '22, April 29-May 5, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA shares content between the menstruating individual and her significant other who is automatically assumed as male. This assumption is not uncommon as Epstein et. al. found that menstrual tracking applications often assume a sexual partner or signifcant other is male <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>. What is uncommon is the ability for the partner to also receive notifcations and information about the menstruating individual's tracked data. This functionality is met with mixed-feelings amongst the participants. Participants from all three methods were against sharing their menstrual data with anyone they knew. However, similar to Rooksby et al.'s observations that tracking is often not just personal but social and collaborative <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>, the participants also did not want to keep the data all to themselves. Who the participant wanted to share with and to what extent varied from one user to the next. While some participants used texting their mothers as a tracking method, others said that they would feel very uncomfortable if their family knew. For who the participants wanted to share with, this category included many more than just their signifcant other as previous tracking methods seem to promote. For some of the participants, they wanted to share with friends, roommates, colleagues, and family and for other participants those were the same populations they did not want to share with. However, if the current application provided sharing capabilities, they were still unable to make these sharing distinctions.</p><p>To summarize, we fnd that current menstrual tracking solutions often not only overlook gender and life stage contexts, but also transitioning into being or not being a menstruator, educational, cultural, sharing, sexual orientation, and impaired contexts as well.</p><p>Recommendation: We suggest for current and future menstrual tracking designs to address diferent life stages-birth control use, pregnancy, perimenopause, menopause, etc.-and transitions between those stages as well as transitions into being or not being a menstruator. Without these accommodations or transitions, we found that the participants have trouble continuing and return to their tracking methods. In addition, we also recommend designs to consider the following categories for more culturally responsive design: diferent age groups, impairments, race/nationalities, sexual orientation, and illnesses relating to gendered health. We also suggest addressing menstrual health education disparities and to provide avenues and resources in which these individuals can seek help in interpreting their health data. For example, the participants in the PD session suggested having Q&amp;A forums in their tracking method so that they could quickly seek out accessible menstrual health information. In addition, we point to projects like Labella that combine underwear and mobile phones as a tool to promote anatomy knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref> and Menstrupedia, a digital platform designed to bridge menstrual health education gaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>, as potential guidance markers for future menstrual tracking methods in terms of promoting menstrual literacy. We point to Kaufman's work for guidance in health education in addressing the intersections of health inequity and menstrual health <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, future work in both menstrual tracking and health disparities could specifcally explore implications for college-educated individuals who are also lacking in basic menstrual health knowledge especially in relation to menstrual "irregularities". Future work is also necessary to fully explore menstrual tracking designs across socioeconomic and education contexts and how these contexts afect an individual's approach to menstrual health care.</p><p>Current applications rarely include sharing capabilities. However, we also suggest that if sharing capabilities are included, that they balance the user's potential wants to connect and share with peers while maintaining strict privacy and limited access of others.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">"What Does My Data Mean?"</head><p>Ruckenstein argues that in personal analytics, how people engage and confront visualized data is just as important as the selfmonitoring device itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. Her fndings suggest that visualized explanations can not only change how the user refects on themselves and their lives but also help them feel permanence, stability, and control. Her participants voiced how their self-tracking technology, with the ability to detect normalities and abnormalities, helped them understand what is physiologically valuable and worth pursuing. This sense of empowerment is not the case within the participants of our study on menstrual tracking.</p><p>The participants felt the same feelings of control from entering data alone. They did not have tracking methods that provided them with easy access to personal analytics capabilities (e.g. some did not have any, others were behind pay walls), but they also did not seek alternatives for analyzing their entered data either. This gap became detrimental to the participants who came from backgrounds that did not provide them with enough menstrual health knowledge to understand the data themselves and prevented them from seeking out medical interpretation as well. They felt comforted from just entering data alone and did not realize anything could be wrong with their menstrual health (e.g. delayed diagnosis of PCOS). To echo Carey et al. sentiments, feelings of control in health "can be comforting but are ultimately useless in terms of maintaining the integrity of an organism in the absence of actual control" <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>.</p><p>On the other hand, we also noticed a common theme amongst the participants who voiced that they would have liked to be able to view their logged data in data visualisations. In our PD, the participants made data visualisation and interaction a priority functionality for their designs and held assumptions that these capabilities would help them interpret data about themselves, akin to the participants from Schroeder et al. study <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. The participants in that study noted how having analyses and visualizations helped them interpret their self-tracked data in the context of their management goals. The need to interpret their data easily from home was especially important to the participants as they often held biases or hesitations towards seeking out menstrual care similar to participants from low income, low menstrual health education, high menstrual stigma, and/or high gender inequities backgrounds from multiple sexual health inequity studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">98]</ref>.</p><p>From all three methods, current tracking users seem to associate tracking with personal analytics, yet were not provided with this functionality in their current method.</p><p>Another interesting avenue for helping an individual understand their data, is potentially through online health communities. Much work has shown the potential online health communities have in promoting empatheic and informational support (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">99]</ref>). The participants in the PD session voiced many scenarios in which they felt comforted speaking to others with similar experiences and also gained valuable information on their own menstrual health. Recommendation: The action of tracking allows the participants to alleviate some of the anxiety that surrounds their menstrual cycles. However, this mitigation can be detrimental when they attribute their peace to being healthy. We suggest future menstrual designs to address their role in reassuring their users, as well as providing the ability for users to be able to make the connection between their tracked data and their health status.</p><p>Current and future menstrual tracking designs could consider ways to better conceptualize or visualize logged menstrual data into trends, insights, and/or cause and efect sequences to help users understand how their entered information relates to their menstrual health. Future work could explore this impact data analytics and visualizations have in bridging the gap between entering data and interpreting menstrual health status.</p><p>Designs might also consider ways to mitigate between how individuals start tracking their period and what individuals end up tracking. Additionally, designs that consider facilitating platforms for menstrual health discussions between individuals might provide them with not only more information, but comfort as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Future Considerations For Ubiquitous Solutions</head><p>The prevalent and unobtrusive nature of ubiquitous computing makes pervasive technologies appealing in the medical informatics space. Much work has demonstrated the potential of ubiquitous computing in facilitating healthcare delivery, tracking, and enhancing efectiveness for health <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>. As follows, self-tracking devices have started to permeate into menstrual tracking as well, such as wearables 2 and smart home devices (e.g., ambient light and coloremitting mirrors <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">34]</ref>). These products are not too diferent from the solutions the participants designed for themselves as the "perfect" tracker. However, the participants were unaware of all of these pre-existing solutions due to their limited knowledge of the menstrual technology market. Without any prior knowledge of existing ubiquitous menstrual tracking solutions, the participants focused on designs to make logging as painless, not intrusive, and adoptable as possible. Their design requirements warranted a pervasive solution. Many of them considered a wearable such as a smart watch as the easiest to adopt, use, and aforded the best privacy. This fnding follows another common theme of combining devices for diferent uses but all under the same purpose. As all of the participants came from industrialized and technology-rich backgrounds, adopting more technology into their daily routine was not foreign to them. The participants envisioned logging their data with a wearable and then viewing their data on a smartphone or computer as the smoothest transition. The participants, even when given the option to have "fantastical" and "impossible" trackers, still prioritized readily available solutions rather than design concepts that were out of their comfort zones. In addition, menstrual health data sharing for the participants required careful curation and as such, also prioritized private and customizable solutions. In the environments the participants grew up in, especially for those with high menstrual stigma, sharing such information with others could either be vital or intrusive .</p><p>As more ubiquitous menstrual tracking solutions proliferate the market, designers should consider not only what the technology tracks and the data it provides, but also the ease of integration of their solution and how it might interact with existing nonubiquitous solutions. For users that are concerned over who else has access to their data, designers should account for the security and privacy they provide their users, their data, and their data sharing.</p><p>Recommendation: We suggest future menstrual tracking designs to address menstrual logging motivations and ease of routine integration. We also suggest looking into the potential of not only ubiquitous computational menstrual tracking solutions, but also how these solutions might interact with each other across platforms in private and secure ways.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>We used a combination of methods to investigate period tracking and sharing practices around menstruating young and educated individuals with minimal menstrual education backgrounds. We found there are multiple design attributes that invoke feelings of alienation and anxiety among the participants such as a lack of consideration for changes in life stage, transitions into being or not being a menstruator menstrual educational background, and with whom and to what extent they would be willing to share menstrual data. In particular, we discuss a potential blind spot in the literature on menstrual tracking applications and health disparities: menstruating individuals who are college-educated but not adequately informed about menstrual health particularities. Although the participants relatively afuent and educated menstruators, they knew little about their own bodies due to their more conservative upbringing and this was likely to put their own health at risk. Future work could further explore this potential menstrual tracking design and health disparity gap. In addition, we found that analyzing data as it pertains to an individual's menstrual health, especially when that individual has minimal menstrual education, is important for the participants. With hesitations in seeking out procare, the participants emphasize a need to visualize their data over time, interpret abnormalities within their logged data accurately, and communicating with other individuals with similar experiences without leaving home. Finally, we provide insight into the design attributes the participants deem absolutely critical for future menstrual tracking solutions-integration with menstrual health education, relatively quick and easy to adopt now, accessible, culturally responsive, private and secured, can be customized, and can provide many actionable insights based on previously entered data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>CHI ' 22 ,</head><label>22</label><figDesc>April 29-May 5, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA</figDesc></figure>
