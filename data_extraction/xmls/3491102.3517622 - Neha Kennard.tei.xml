<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>HCI is increasingly concerned with health information quality and spread of misinformation on social media. Despite many major platforms having been adopted across the world, the situated evaluation and sharing of health information is underexplored across diverse health systems and cultural and political contexts. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, we study the navigation of health information on social media in urban and rural South India, backdropped by plural knowledges around health and the specifc politics and sociality of health and social media in this setting. We use Ivan Illich's concept of tools for conviviality <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[49]</ref> to distinguish between how people creatively use tools versus how tools manage and impose values on people-participants aimed to use health information towards care beyond institutionalized healthcare, but insidious misinformation and information-sharing practices served to commodify, spark uncertainty in, and discipline caring behavior. We use our fndings to expand understandings of the use of health information on social media and how positionality shapes how people are afected by and respond to misinformation. We also draw attention to the structural aspects of health misinformation in the Indian context and how the design of social media platforms might play a role in addressing it.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>There has been a proliferation of information related to health and wellbeing on social media, whether it is from news media, health or government organizations, or individual users. This prevalance Richard Anderson anderson@cs.washington.edu University of Washington USA has prompted HCI and related felds to study health information quality and how people assess and share health information on large, open social media platforms such as Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter. Relatively more recently, crises such as the Zika virus epidemic or the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have necessitated attention to further complexities of health information quality, such as decision-making amidst constant uncertainty, hostility towards public health guidelines, and the intersection of health with political and economic issues. Research has increasingly examined the role of information in risk assessment and conspiracy theorizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">90]</ref>, and the intersections of political discourse and health misinformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">75]</ref>. Viewing social media itself as a site of intervention, studies have proposed ways to support quality online discussion and assessment of risk and uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">90]</ref>, tools to identify health misinformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">38]</ref>, and techniques to correct health misinformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">112,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">113]</ref>. This body of work often focuses on the realities of Global North contexts or relies on analysis of open social media platforms. However, recent studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">106]</ref> have pointed out how diferent cultural, economic, and political specifcities matter deeply to our understanding of navigation of health information and tools to support healthier online spaces. For example, studies have examined the inaccessibility of technology for fact-checking in rural Bangladesh <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[106]</ref>, the prevalence of "positive energy" propaganda in Chinese social media content <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[75]</ref>, and the use of health misinformation for political aims in India <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[4]</ref>. Further, by looking at individuals' perceptions and navigation of health information across multiple channels, including closed social media like chat apps, we can better understand health information ecologies more broadly and how they are situated in the sociality of social media in specifc contexts.</p><p>In this paper, we present an interview study of how participants in rural and urban South India navigate health information on social media, related to COVID-19 and more generally. We spoke with both residents and community health workers, and also analyzed health-related content that participants had come across and shared with us. Colonial histories in India have led to multiple systems of allopathic, traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine (TCAM) co-existing, often in specifc confgurations and hierarchies based on people's identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[23]</ref>. Additionally, the social media ecosystem in India has been heavily shaped by increased but inequitable online participation, increased circulation of misinformation, and divisive ethno-nationalist politics <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[59]</ref>. A qualitative approach enabled us to understand how engagement with multiple systems of health intersect with the sociality of social media and the local cultural and political context to shape engagement with health information online and ofine.</p><p>We analyzed our data through the lens of conviviality as proposed by Ivan Illich <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[49]</ref>, which allowed us to attend to the tension between participants' personal goals when navigating health information and the impositional values of health misinformation and information-sharing practices that they encountered. Illich critiques the industrialization and bureaucratization of tools and institutions such as modern transportation, healthcare, and education, arguing that they have come to focus on proft and dependence on overly specialized knowledge. He proposes conviviality as an alternative guiding value for the design of tools. Drawing on examples such as telephones and libraries, Illich defnes convivial tools as ones that support creative, autonomous action as well as interdependence among people and their environment. The lens of conviviality thus calls for attention to how tools support creative interaction, versus how tools might coerce or control action. This diferentiation allowed us to tease out the ways that participants worked towards conviviality in health and social media use, while also attending to the structural nature of the problem of health misinformation.</p><p>Our resultant contribution to HCI is two-fold. First, we ofer refections on situated engagement with health information on social media in contexts in South India, and how we might further understand and support conviviality in health and social media use. Second, we draw on Illich's provocation that we must actively limit the growth of tools in favor of conviviality to discuss how we might address the conditions that reinforce misinformation, situated in the politics of health and social media in India.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>To contextualize our fndings, we start by providing background on information and health ecologies in India. We then describe related work on social media use and health, as well as political and health misinformation. We end with an overview of Illich's argument for conviviality and how it aids our analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Information and Health Ecologies in India</head><p>In this study, we considered health information as any information, from individuals or organizations, that discussed explanations, advice, experiences, or current events around health and wellbeing. Certain terms for information quality have come into popular use, including in the context of our study. We use misinformation as a term for "false or inaccurate information that is deliberately created and is intentionally or unintentionally propagated" <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[115]</ref>, while disinformation is associated with intentionality to deceive, often with a larger strategic or political intent <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[103,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">115]</ref>. The term "fake news" can refer to misinformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[59]</ref> but also has been weaponized to label any information that does not align with a group's goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[13]</ref>. The broader information ecosystem in India has been marked by cheaper and increasing mobile internet access, with WhatsApp, Facebook, and YouTube becoming popular platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[59]</ref>. Politically, with the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leading the government since 2014, political aims have centered around Hindu nationalist ideology, which seeks to erode secularism to establish a Hindu nation-state, further entrenching the caste system and constructions of religious minorities, particularly Muslims, as enemies of the state <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[5]</ref>. The party's information technology (IT) cell has been found to spread disinformation on social media in support of these goals. Meanwhile, some Indian news channels have even participated in amplifying misinformation, and have increasingly blurred lines between on-the-ground reporting and analysis and opinion <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">83]</ref>.</p><p>India's health system incorporates both allopathic treatment, sometimes referred to as Western or English medicine, and TCAM. TCAM in India is often tied to religion, for example Ayurveda is rooted in Hinduism, while Unani is prevalent in Muslim communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[23]</ref>. The Indian government formally supports TCAM, integrating AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy) into national health programs. Far from being a neutral choice, uptake of TCAM versus allopathic medicine is tied to social position, dependent on cost, trust, and alignment with cultural or religious values, even when efcacy varies <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">105]</ref>. In the context of such diverse knowledges around health, community health workers in India (known as Accredited Social Health Activists or ASHAs) leverage intimate knowledge of their local communities to raise awareness of community health concerns and ways to address them and connect residents with public health services <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">110]</ref>. There are also political facets to AYUSH that must be addressed. Historically and continuing under BJP leadership, the uptake of TCAM and Ayurveda in particular has been encouraged as a form of patriotism and a counter to Western hegemony <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">62]</ref>. However, this connection has been problematized as refecting elite dominant caste traditions, and feeding into Hindu nationalist ideology <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[62]</ref>. It is within such an environment that we study the navigation of online health information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Health and Social Media Use</head><p>There have been numerous studies on health information on social media in health, technology, and communications publications, often utilizing surveys and experiments to model how people assess and share health information. Many studies in India focus on acceptability of social media for seeking health information <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">42]</ref>. Studies across East Asia and India have also examined adoption, trust, and sharing, fnding that people seek and share health information because of benefts related to usefulness, presentation, and informational and emotional support <ref type="bibr">[15, 71-73, 99, 104]</ref>. However, this is tempered by risks such as credibility, negative efects on peace of mind, time required to verify, and presence of advertisements <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">122]</ref>. Cross-cultural studies have noted fndings such as lower willingness to seek health information on social media or more intermediated searches in Eastern contexts compared to the West <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">101]</ref>.</p><p>Prior work in HCI has discussed the importance of generative models of culture in order to better understand variations within cultural contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[51]</ref>, making interpretive approaches important to consider as well. In early work, De Choudhury et al. found that Twitter is seen as a more public forum for sharing information and garnering opinions, while search engines are for more private searches about stigmatized or serious illness <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[31]</ref>. A number of other studies focus on information-seeking for specifc conditions, such as HIV <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">84]</ref>, maternal and child health <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">120]</ref>, diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[45]</ref>, and transgender health <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[9]</ref>, among others <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">107]</ref>). Early studies in Global South contexts focused on the role of tools like interactive voice response systems, SMS, video, and posters in health communication, describing how it is shaped by factors like stigma, family structures, specifc technological afordances, and preexisting beliefs about certain conditions (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">100]</ref>). Recent work has begun to note ways that the adoption of social media and information quality is shaping health-and informationseeking, motivating a broader look at health information quality and how people navigate it. For example, studies in urban India describe how diabetic patients experiment with home remedies from social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[45]</ref> or how ASHAs use WhatsApp for communicating with local residents <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[53]</ref>. At the same time, we also see fndings such as how pregnant women in rural northwest India encounter misinformation about maternal health on YouTube <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[11]</ref>.</p><p>There is a rich body of literature looking at the adoption and sociality of social media and mobile internet in the Global South, which serves to contextualize the consumption and sharing of health information. For example, studies in India, Bangladesh, Kenya, and Namibia have shown that social media and internet use are deeply tied to social and entrepreneurial aspirations to widen one's reach <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">119]</ref>, expressing identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[89]</ref>, fnding and conveying love <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[8]</ref>, or building social status as online content aggregators <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">93]</ref>. A body of work attends to women's experiences online in India and Kenya, fnding a spectrum of use that is shaped by digital literacies, afordances of social media, and moves towards empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">117,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">118]</ref>. However, other studies in South Asia demonstrate the extensive privacy concerns and safety risks that women take on to use phones and social media platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">96,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">97,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">109]</ref>. Though prior work increasingly shows engagement with health information on social media in diverse contexts, it must also be understood in relation to the goals and social position of users. Our work takes a holistic look at navigation of health information online to contextualize issues of information quality in rural and urban contexts in South India.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Rumors and Misinformation</head><p>The body of work on rumors and misinformation about technology, politics, and crises, both ofine and online, speaks to diverse motivations for the creation and circulation of misinformation. Multiple studies in the Global South have looked at how rumors about technology build users' social status, help make sense of events in light of mistrust in formal institutions, and erect barriers to use <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">95,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">116]</ref>. In studies of online spaces across the Global South and North, prior work notes the role of afect <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[47]</ref>, expressions of identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">103]</ref>, and prejudices <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">94]</ref> in the unintentional and intentional spread of misinformation. There are also more structural and centralized factors that incentivize circulation such as strategic information operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">102,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">103]</ref>, proft-driven fake news publishers <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[22]</ref>, recommendation algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[48]</ref>, and social media afordances that ease sharing <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[34]</ref>. As such, political and cultural contexts matter to the meanings and motivations behind sharing (mis)information. In studies within the Global South, Lu et al. discuss how experiences with WeChat misinformation, often from the government itself, actually contribute to pro-censorship views <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[74]</ref>, while Banaji and Bhat's study of mob violence and WhatsApp in India fnds that content about suspicious activity is often spread out of prejudice or a sense of duty to keep one's community safe, rather than accidentally <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[13]</ref>.</p><p>HCI and related felds have increasingly explored health information quality specifcally. Prior work has focused on decision-making during crises such as the Zika virus epidemic or COVID-19 pandemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">121]</ref>, largely in the Global North context. These studies note political concerns such as the rise of conspiracy theories given low information and institutional uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[65]</ref> or use of data visualization to promote unorthodox science <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[70]</ref>. In Global South contexts, alternative health practices and signifcant institutional capture shape studies of health misinformation. Prior work in Vietnam and Bangladesh shows how creating, seeking, and verifying health information is more rooted in preserving religious and cultural values and community wellbeing, rather than scientifc accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">106]</ref>. Political contexts also intersect-Lu et al.'s study of COVID-19 misinformation on WeChat in China found that some participants prioritized sharing content containing "positive energy" propaganda (deployed by the government) over veracity <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[75]</ref>. Akbar et al. 's study found that misinformation about Muslims and Chinese people as purposeful spreaders of COVID-19 reinforced Indian politicians' construction of minorities as political enemies on Twitter <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[4]</ref>. In our study, we focus on not just culturally situated health practices, but also how plural knowledges around health manifest in social media use, and attend to the points where information is no longer helpful but harmful, and how participants navigate these moments.</p><p>Considering the potential harms of health-related and other types of misinformation online, prior work has sought to improve identifcation, fact-checking, and correction of health and other misinformation online. Some studies have developed tools to identify fake or alternative cures in order to better understand misinformation and support research <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">38]</ref>. A body of work has proposed prompts for users to consider accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[87]</ref> and the use of algorithmic, social, and organizational corrections to misinformation as ways of stemming its spread <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">112,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">113]</ref>. Studies show that these strategies can be efective in a variety of formats and tones <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">46]</ref>, but prior work also points out that these studies may not account for specifcities of Global South contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[114]</ref>, such as the popularity of WhatsApp, where information is often received from trusted close ties. Indeed, studies in Global South contexts such as Brazil, India, and Bangladesh have proposed and developed specifc identifcation tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">79]</ref>, correction methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[10]</ref>, and fact-checking support <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">106]</ref>. For example, Badrinathan et al. fnd that even brief expressions of doubt in a WhatsApp post can reduce belief in misinformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[10]</ref>. At the same time, prior work also suggests taking a more holistic approach that goes beyond judging or correcting individual pieces of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[78]</ref>. Researchers suggest moderating based on the strategic goal of an information campaign <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[103]</ref> or augmenting human judgement by ofering other sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[36]</ref>. They also recommend considering medical uncertainty and multiple moralities at play in moderation and fact-checking <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">106]</ref>, and investing in teaching functional and critical media literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[13]</ref>. Our focus on individuals' needs for information versus the challenges introduced by broader factors such as the sociality of social media allow us to consider multiple avenues to healthier online spaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Tools for Conviviality</head><p>To analyze how participants wanted to use health information and social media towards a care-driven society, compared to the insidious misinformation and behavior they encountered online, we use Illich's analytic framework of tools for conviviality <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[49]</ref>. He draws on the historical trajectory of tools and institutions across the world to articulate a critique of industrialization and bureaucratization and pose conviviality as the preferred goal for the design of tools and collectives. In a ftting example, Illich describes how medicine and public health policy at frst produced widely useful tools like vaccines and condoms. However, at a certain point, healthcare became proft-oriented and focused on self-perpetuation without questioning whether unrestricted growth and specialization of the healthcare industry actually serves people. He argues that this has contributed to dependence on medical knowledge and being less able to meaningfully care for one another. In comparison, convivial tools like telephones or libraries are accessible, and support creative, autonomous action as well as interdependence. We thus look at how conviviality of health and social communication is and is not supported as participants navigate health information.</p><p>Illich discusses fve ways in which too much focus on efciency of tools can erode conviviality-biological degradation, radical monopoly, overprogramming, polarization, and obsolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[49]</ref>. Three of these are particularly relevant to our analysis of social media use and health information. Radical monopoly refers to the monopoly of a particular way of life, such as when a city is built only for cars, rather than any other mode of transportation. In our fndings, we discuss how participants saw health information as part of resisting the dominance of any one form of care to fnd a balance between allopathic care and other forms of care. Overprogramming refers to programmed education that is only achievable through specialized and often commodifed training, compared to learning that can be achieved through experience and everyday sharing of knowledge. We describe how health misinformation fed the commodifcation of care, including home remedies that were meant to be accessible, and created doubt in everyday care practices. Polarization describes the concentration of wealth and control in the hands of elite, while the poor grow in number and materials inequalities worsen. In the fndings, we consider how misinformation functions to further religious divides and other inequities, and how participants coped and responded. Illich also discusses the importance of placing limits on tools to preserve conviviality. Our discussion expands on this idea in considering how to address online health misinformation.</p><p>Prior work in the Global South has drawn on conviviality to analyze social media, design, and information systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">86]</ref>. This framework allows us to highlight how participants used social media and health information towards caring for themselves and others, versus when particular logics, discourses, and moves towards institutionalization disrupt care. Additionally, defning tools to include devices and infrastructures makes this lens appropriate for attending to both how health information is used for specifc confgurations of care, and how social media is used with varying degrees of conviviality in mind. Among lenses such as postcolonial computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[51]</ref> and feminist HCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[14]</ref> that also bring attention to subjectivities and appropriation of technologies designed in the context of inequities, Illich delves into the specifc balances that, if upset, serve to control people more than support creative action.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHODS</head><p>The goal of the study was to understand how people across rural and urban locales and diverse socioeconomic backgrounds encounter and navigate health information online, also attending to how this intersects with social media use and beliefs around health more generally. We describe our data collection and analysis below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Data Collection</head><p>We conducted 28 semi-structured interviews, from July to December of 2020. Participants were recruited through purposive and snowball sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">108]</ref> from two locations in South India: Miyapur 1 , a village in the coastal region of Andhra Pradesh, and Hyderabad, the shared capital city of the recently split states Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Hyderabad is a major city, and Miyapur is approximately one hour from the nearest peri-urban town. These locations were chosen in order to sample across rural and urban locations, which have diferent forms of access to healthcare, in related cultural milieus. We also had local ties that would allow us to recruit participants diverse in gender, income, and age. Because we were aiming to study health information on social media, we recruited participants who owned or had access to a smartphone. After interviews demonstrated that ASHAs were integral to sensemaking around COVID-19 in Miyapur, we recruited three ASHAs via snowball sampling.</p><p>Participants from Miyapur consisted of ten women and seven men (including the ASHAs we interviewed). Ages ranged from 22 to 61. Thirteen participants' family incomes were in the lower-middle income range, with some participants using government benefts such as ration cards, and four were middle-income. Participants' occupations included farming, school teachers, shop owners, housewives, and government volunteers (comprising ASHAs and ward volunteers who inform households about government schemes, including COVID-19 testing). Participants from Hyderabad consisted of six women and fve men, ranging in age from 23 to 50. Most family incomes were in the low and lower-middle income brackets for urban areas, with three participants in the middle-income bracket <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[32]</ref>. Participants included drivers, maids, hotel staf, accountants, information technology professionals, and housewives. Most participants had bachelor's degrees, with three urban participants and three rural participants having completed some or all of grade school. All low and lower-middle income participants accessed care through the public health system. All participants were Hindu. This means our fndings do not refect the experiences of religious minorities, who might hold diferent beliefs about health and related politics and can often be the target of misinformation. In the fndings, we refer to urban participants with ID Ux and rural participants with ID Rx.</p><p>Interviews were conducted over phone by the frst author and consisted of questions about demographics, the process of informationseeking around health concerns and questions, social media use, and encounters with health information online. ASHAs were additionally asked about their work responsibilities, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the relationship they saw between their work and health information circulating online. Interviews were 30 minutes to one hour. Most were conducted in Telugu, with a few in English, based on participants' preferences. Interviews were recorded with participants' consent, or detailed handwritten notes were taken. To understand the types of messages participants described in interviews, participants were also asked to forward any health information they mentioned in their interview (if it was still available on their phone). Through this process, we received 20 WhatsApp forwards, Facebook posts, and YouTube videos.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Data Analysis</head><p>We took an inductive interpretive approach to data analysis, as described by Merriam <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[80]</ref>. Both authors discussed the data as interviews were conducted, allowing us to refne some of the questions we asked. Namely, if participants mentioned particular rumors or national news stories, we asked other participants if they had come across them too, which allowed us to get multiple perspectives on these events. Using coding as a process towards developing themes, Naveena translated and conducted open coding on transcripts and notes, fnding initial themes such as "searching for experiential knowledge online", "confronting misinformation ofine", and "suspicion of alarming news". She also coded the messages participants shared, noting themes such as "motivating reasons for sharing" and "justifying sharing of the post". She conducted further rounds of coding at a higher level, distilling codes into themes such as "role of health information in traditional care practices" and "stoking fear/mistrust". Naveena and Richard discussed these themes to refne them and detail the analysis they support. Through this process, we saw that the themes highlighted how the navigation of health information online was intertwined with one's goals and values around wellbeing but also marked by the disciplining and commodifcation of care. This tension aligned with the lens of conviviality, which we use to present and discuss our fndings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Positionality</head><p>We are researchers based in the United States. Naveena is a woman of Indian origin, from Hyderabad, Telangana, and raised in the United States. She is from a dominant caste community. Richard is a white man from the United States. A limitation to the study is that due to the sensitivities of a dominant caste researcher asking about participants' caste, particularly in initial interactions, Naveena did not collect this data. However, caste is a signifcant axis of discrimination impacting the rights and wellbeing of non-dominant caste and indigenous communities, including Dalits and Adivasis, and could be integral to fully understanding experiences of navigating health information on social media and ofine.</p><p>In asking participants about misinformation, we aimed to be sensitive to defnitions of misinformation. We asked local ties what would be the best way to ask about misinformation, fnding that the terms "misinformation" or "fake news" were most commonly used. In interviews, we sought to reduce our assumptions about what is considered misinformation by frst encouraging participants to share about any health-related content they had come across and how they perceived it, and then asking about misinformation directly. As researchers, we also came in with our own commitments around critically examining where misinformation comes from and its function, particularly in the context of plural health systems and axes of discrimination within Indian society.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">FINDINGS</head><p>Our fndings start with the ways that participants use health information to help them care for themselves and others, often explicitly outside the realm of institutionalized healthcare. We then describe disruptions in this efort towards care, where misinformation circulating online serves discourses that seek to diminish a sense of safety and community, discipline how people care, and instrumentalize the sharing of information itself. We end with the tactics that participants used towards resisting misinformation and working towards healthier online spaces. Throughout, we draw on the concepts that Illich argues erode conviviality, and describe how they are resisted or entrenched in social media use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Caring Through Health Information on Social Media</head><p>To contextualize where participants came across health information, Facebook, YouTube, and WhatsApp were used by almost every participant. WhatsApp was used most frequently. All participants had small groups for friends, family, or school. Many were part of large groups for work or communities like women's groups. Rural participants, along with urban participants who migrated from villages, were part of large groups for village announcements. Overall, participants' social media interactions with health information were shaped by the desire to live a healthier life, using the tools at one's disposal. Participants also aimed to be sensitive to the social meanings of sharing health information. We highlight how, through seeking and sharing health information, participants resisted certain manifestations of a radical monopoly of institutionalized healthcare over care and medicine, and afrmed conviviality through interdependence and care outside of institutions.</p><p>4.1.1 Using Information to Care. The health information that participants most often came across on social media refected a mix of content created by individual users and organizations. Participants often encountered messages, posts, and videos by individuals about Ayurvedic home remedies. They also saw content or were part of Facebook groups centered on promoting good health through culturally situated nutrition and lifestyle changes. Participants also watched interviews with healthcare professionals, and were interested in informative news, for example, about COVID-19-related developments and case counts, or new research on common chronic illnesses such as diabetes or hypertension.</p><p>Posts and videos about Ayurvedic home remedies were common but especially so at the start of the pandemic. Many participants found these useful and shared them with friends or family because they embodied forms of care that were accessible and familiar. This contextualizes notions of usefulness and beneft that motivate sharing in prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[72]</ref>. Across income levels, participants said they followed home remedies out of convenience, as the foods required to make them were easily available. Convenience became especially important when the pandemic introduced uncertainty and lockdowns. Though participants saw the importance of quarantining and followed the news for case counts or vaccine development, social media content about home remedies was a tool that flled in the material and knowledge gaps of formal institutions guiding public health measures. For example, R15 noted that boosting immunity through garlic or lemon was easier to follow using everyday ingredients in the kitchen, while advice circulating about procuring materials such as masks and hand sanitizer was less accessible given lack of availability in the village. Other participants said that because there was no defnitive allopathic treatment for COVID-19, home remedies were what was feasible, and social media posts gave participants an idea of which remedies exactly would be useful. We do note, however, that advice about what more one could do in light of the pandemic was not limited to home remedies. For example, U5 bought a pulse oximeter based on a WhatsApp forward, deciding this would be useful based on her knowledge of the respiratory symptoms of COVID-19.</p><p>Health information on social media also allowed some participants to limit what they saw as a dependency on English medicine and lifestyles, which they felt was more likely to cause side effects and lower one's immunity over time, aligning with Illich's characterization of radical monopolies that induce dependency. Participants also delineated how they sought care for "smaller" and "bigger" ailments. Smaller ailments included issues such as indigestion or colds, while larger ailments encompassed chronic conditions such as diabetes or cancer. Online health information helped handle these smaller ailments on one's own, without going to the hospital. Many participants watched videos of doctors on YouTube, either through news channels featuring interviews, or YouTube content created by doctors themselves, some of whom had a signifcant following due to their position at prominent hospitals in Hyderabad. U10 saw such videos as a way to avoid in-person consultations:</p><p>"If it's a small problem, and we don't think a consultation is necessary, on YouTube there's many doctors who will do a consultation, they'll talk about problems, like 'If you do this it'll be nice. ' For small things don't go, it's not necessary, no need to be afraid of small things. " U10's desire to not fear small things hints at the desire for assurance of being able to care for oneself and minimize unnecessary reliance on English medicine. Notably, the videos still had advice from doctors practicing allopathic medicine, refecting prior fndings on trust in allopathic doctors' authority <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">105]</ref>. However, it did not require formal engagement with the healthcare system. Another dimension of reducing dependence on doctors was the desire to cultivate one's own awareness and skills for managing one's health. R13, who was interested in content about home remedies as well as medical news about developments in treating chronic illnesses, explained his interests: "We need to think with our own awareness... we only want to depend on doctors for just 25%, even with diabetes, blood pressure, thyroid. The rest we must manage on our own, because it's our life. " Thus, seeking health information was a way to keep engaged with one's health, rather than only engaging through interactions with doctors.</p><p>4.1.2 Using Social Media with Care. Decisions around when to share information and with whom was tied to personal preferences and assessments of credibility, but also maintenance of relationships and the social fabric of online communities. This aligns with Illich's argument that conviviality is defned by both autonomy and consideration of others' rights. When asked how they decided to share health information, many participants said that they wanted to share information that was positive, hopeful, credible, and helpful to others, particularly if it was relevant to a health concern someone was facing, aligning with prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[72]</ref>. In terms of deciding what was not quality information, participants often steered clear of information that seemed to contradict what they grew up learning about from elders, or their understanding of how particular home remedies should be used in particular geographies (for example, in South versus North India). They also had an instinct for what was fake, often simply saying, "It will seem diferent. " To elaborate, participants provided examples of videos or posts that overpromised results from home remedies, tablets, or other products, made statements about current events that were not corroborated on television news or the newspaper, or reported on events that happened in the distant past as if they happened recently.</p><p>Regardless of their personal evaluation of health information, participants were generally careful about sharing it beyond close family or friends in consideration of diverse values around health and ways to be healthy, contextualizing notions of social risk in prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[72]</ref>. For example, even if R17 found messages about Ayurveda useful, he would not forward them to anyone because that would encroach on others' notions of how to care for their health: "I won't force them on anyone. That's their individuality right?". For some participants, such messages that were overtly religious were particularly problematic when shared on large work or community groups, given the context of religious tensions in the country. For example, R13 shared how he disapproved of forwards about or related to Hinduism in large work groups on WhatsApp and asked members to not forward such posts because, "Diferent religions will be there, diferent castes will be there... there could be Christians, Muslims, anyone. Sikh or Buddhist. How would it feel for them? How would it feel to see these posts?" He then lamented that this is how arguments start on groups, creating tensions and eventually eclipsing the original purpose of the group.</p><p>Despite participants' desire to share positive and trustworthy messages and within the appropriate circles, curiosity and hopefulness upon fnding new information about common and chronic health concerns was also a signifcant motivator for sharing health information, even if participants did not understand it entirely. For example, U11 noted that he shared an ad from Facebook for a clinic that ofers diabetes reversal, because it sounded new and was garnering attention: ...as I said I'm not familiar, but yes it sounded interesting... when you hear something new which will reduce something, everybody will be on it... Whatever comes free, people try to opt for it... one of my friends consulted with them, in fact. We simultaneously see the industrialization of healthcare creeping in through the presence of ads on social media, the desire for accessible and efective care, and the motivation to share potentially useful ideas, demonstrating the appeal of promising information in the face of challenges of chronic illness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">The Role of Information Flows in Community</head><p>Health. The context of COVID-19 also compelled us to look at information fows at the community level. In Miyapur in particular, we found that open lines of communication between ASHAs and the community were integral to visibilizing and strengthening the interdependence of community members, a key aspect of conviviality. When community spread increased in India, received trainings on how to communicate COVID-19 guidelines and visited households to survey their travel and inform them about the guidelines. R6 explained that not every household received this information well, and some even tried to blame her for needing to quarantine. The ASHAs would persist and explain that those who did not quarantine would be talked about negatively in the village, leveraging the fow of information and interrelation of people within the community. On average though, both ASHAs and other participants noted that households were following guidelines when needed. also played role in quelling anxieties and building confdence in collective care. R6 told us that she would sometimes be asked by households to talk to neighbors who seemed like they were venturing outside their home or who were having relatives over (this being the reason for the frst positive case in the village). In this case, ASHAs were intermediaries among households, as their longstanding positions in the community and authority as health workers made conversations around quarantine more acceptable. ASHAs were also key actors in supporting sensemaking about changes in COVID-19 cases in the village. R1 shared how when the frst case in the village was discovered, everyone was alerted via megaphone announcements broadcasted from vehicles traveling through the village and there was a lockdown. However, there was later rumored to be another positive case, and without a villagewide alert, her family relied on ASHAs to provide more information and learned that it was not true. ASHAs confrmed that households often anxiously inquired about positive cases.</p><p>As pandemic progressed, quarantine measures were successful in preventing in the village. ASHAs were not as active in surveying households for the purposes of encouraging adherence to public health guidelines, and more people in the village and surrounding areas were not following guidelines as stringently. In this case, social media came into play as a tool to support interdependence even without the impetus of formal institutions. Some locals began creating or sharing social media content that encouraged caution. U17 enjoyed listening to songs on Facebook and mentioned how a local resident who often wrote and produced folk-style songs had written one about COVID-19 precautions, as well as other songs providing critical social commentary on the central government's response to COVID-19. U17 shared the song to friends and certain village groups, feeling it was an efective way to encourage precautions again.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Disruption and Disciplining of Care through Social Media</head><p>We also found disruptions in participants' eforts towards greater conviviality in health and social media use. Participants encountered online discourse that promoted the commodifcation of care, fear and uncertainty in care practices, and discriminatory discourse of who deserves care and who does not, all of which contributed to overprogramming and polarization of care. We also describe how the content of misinformation and certain patterns of social media use contributed to the sharing of information itself as a way to show care and gain status, or what Illich calls the "inversion of means into ends" <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[49]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Commodification and</head><p>Co-opting of Care. Participants came across posts that commodifed care and practices, turning home remedies into a specifed program or regimen, refecting Illich's concept of overprogramming. discussed the commercialization of Ayurveda-for example, she often saw forwards from friends about products from a company owned by Baba Ramdev, a yoga guru and businessman who has commercialized Ayurvedic recipes and often links the brand to economic and religious nationalism <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[60]</ref>. U14 described how these posts insisted that these products worked, did not have any evidence of who thinks that they work or how. In contrast to home remedies that participants felt may or may not work but at least relied on materials that one might get from their kitchen, such posts promoted Ayurveda itself as a product to consume. Another example demonstrated the efects of the increasing use globally of social media to market medications directly to consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[77]</ref>. Indicative of polarization, or the concentration of power within an increasingly predatory elite, some participants felt that advertisements for health-related products on social media were of dubious quality and often took advantage of hopefulness in new treatments for chronic illnesses such as diabetes (a feeling that we described above). R17 described how he tried tablets that would supposedly improve symptoms of diabetes after seeing an ad. When he messaged the seller after a month to explain that it was inefective, he was told the dosage was wrong and to purchase another month's supply, after which he decided they were untrustworthy. However, he later saw television ads for the product, indicating their continued digital presence. There were also many posts that demonstrated overprogramming by co-opting diferent knowledges to justify misinformation, emphasizing certain forms of authority over lived experiences and critical thinking. Numerous posts that participants with us, especially from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, ofered seemingly scientifc explanations for Ayurvedic remedies that would supposedly cure COVID-19, which some participants felt were intended to appeal to people's desire for agency over the practices they followed. For example, R19 shared with us a post, written in Telugu, that claimed lemon juice and warm water could remove the virus before it reaches the lungs, or that eating foods with a high pH could neutralize the virus. While participants indicated that they did not believe in such cures, this style of explanation shows how traditional practices perpetuate themselves by co-opting the language of other knowledges, which at a national level, has justifed the promotion of fake cures for COVID-19 by the central government's Ministry of AYUSH itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[69]</ref>.</p><p>The authority of allopathic practitioners was also used to justify misinformation. U2 described a forward she had shared on WhatsApp years ago about advice on how women should stop using Whisper or Stayfree pads because numerous deaths had resulted from using one pad for the whole day. The post claimed that this was a "public service message" from respected hospitals in the nation, though the claims in the post have since been found to be false <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Though U2 researched the post online due to its seriousness, she could not fnd an explanation at the time, making the post trustworthy enough to pass on. We also saw examples of local content creation that leveraged medical authority to make misleading claims. A participant sent us a Facebook video from a pulmonologist in a nearby town, claiming that people living with HIV are unafected by COVID-19. The doctor added a screenshot of a WhatsApp conversation in the comments as supporting evidence, though neither the newspaper clipping nor the article shown in the screenshot actually claim that people living with HIV are at lower risk. There were a mix of comments on the post grateful for the information, furthering the claim, or refuting it. In this case, we see the poster's identity as a physician and the deployment of other trusted sources as forms of authority to support false claims.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.2.2</head><p>Fomenting Doubt in Care Practices. In another example of overprogramming, misinformation could spark doubt in how one went about everyday caring work, suggesting that people cannot entirely rely on their own experiences. Other than the Whisper and Stayfree pads example described above, U4 mentioned a number of messages intended to create mistrust in widely used brands of household goods, such as four, chocolate, and infant formula. For example, she came across a video that claimed to demonstrate that Aashirvaad brand atta, or four, contains plastic, or a post that claimed that an employee living with HIV was batches of Cadbury brand chocolate with blood, both of which have been debunked <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">91]</ref>. She found these posts concerning as she had a child and family to care for and regularly purchased these items. She used online fact-checking services to worry less. Notably, reduced confdence is not the only concern. In the case of the Cadbury chocolate post, the claims perpetuate stigma and misinformation about health conditions and how they spread.</p><p>Misinformation also contributed to doubt in whether people could keep themselves safe despite their best eforts. Misinformation about the death toll of COVID-19 has been heavily circulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[4]</ref>, often including graphic images of mass casualties taken from a diferent context and purported to refect COVID-19 deaths. Participants wanted to avoid seeing or sharing such content since it made the public less confdent in what they could or could not do safely during the pandemic. R17 was disturbed by such images that he had seen on WhatsApp and how people could justify sharing them, particularly when they did not seem to be corroborated by the newspaper, he saw as a more authoritative source. He expressed how even if the stories were true, such messaging was extremely unproductive: "Even if it's original, because it's about death, I don't like upsetting others, so I don't share... We're that someone died of Corona... okay. From that death, we're learning that we need to take precautions, but saying mounds and mounds of people are dying, creating photos... " Here, we see that fear-mongering works against conviviality as practiced through reasonable precautions and care-ful information sharing. We also fnd that even if the news was true, participants prioritized preserving confdence in actionable precautions, nuancing prior work on additional ways to assess information beyond veracity <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">106]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Widening Rifs in Collective</head><p>Care. Another way that health information was a conduit for disciplining care was manipulating who deserved care and who was caring for the collective appropriately, contributing to polarization between an elite nationalist agenda and marginalized populations. In March 2020, a gathering of Islamic religious scholars for a conference at the Nizamuddin Markaz mosque in Delhi became a signifcant source of COVID-19 spread, resulting in increased circulation of misinformation claiming that Muslims were purposefully spreading the virus, particularly through serviceoriented work such as cooking or chaufeuring <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">12]</ref>. Indicating the efect of this discourse on the maintenance of collective care in Miyapur, ASHAs told us how some residents became particularly suspicious of Muslim households. R6 described how this manifested in having to navigate targeted questions from residents: "...a few people in the village asked. 'They did it, they brought it [the virus], if they didn't go, it wouldn't have spread, they did it on purpose, did any of them come to our village from the meeting?'" Confronted with such inquiries, ASHAs said they chose to emphasize that anyone who traveled, regardless of where, is quarantining at home so COVID-19 will not spread further. More generally, ASHAs felt it was important to never explicitly discuss political events or opinions. First, this would make maintaining relationships to all residents difcult, impacting their ability to work efectively. Second, though ASHAs in this village were largely trusted and supported in their work, there was still a concern that engaging with political topics could have professional consequences, especially as ASHAs are at the bottom of the healthcare hierarchy. Two ASHAs told us about nearby villages where ASHAs faced a lack of cooperation from the Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) and doctors at local primary health centers due to political party afliations and were falsely accused of not completing work and threatened with having their positions taken away.</p><p>ASHAs described how there have always been misconceptions and stigma to tackle as community health workers, for example about how HIV is contracted-beliefs that are passed on from generation to generation and within communities. Additionally, discrimination against religious minorities in India has been ongoing. However, in this case, current events were falsely framed by political and media elite to present Muslims as the very enemies of collective care, bringing up targeted questions of loyalty and intentionality that ASHAs needed navigate on the ground. 4.2.4 Sharing (Mis)information as Care and Status. We found that misinformation often turned the act of sharing information itself into a form of care, and that forwarding any information, regardless of quality, was associated with social status. These fndings demonstrate how information sharing can turn from a means to an end, which Illich argues contributes to the erosion of conviviality.</p><p>Some social media posts attempted to garner forwards by equating care with sharing. In the case of the post about the Whisper and Stayfree pads mentioned by U2, the post encouraged forwarding to "all girls and even boys that they can share with their wives and friends, whom they care for." U2 said it directly informed who she decided to forward the message to. The post positions forwarding health information as a form of care, one that is important enough to share "even" across otherwise strong gender norms around women's health. In another example participants shared with us, a post about someone who required an eye transplant claimed that each time the message was forwarded, patient was automatically given one paisa (1/100th of an Indian rupee). The message ended with a claim that "If this is fake, we'll lose two minutes of our lives. If it's real, he will have eyes. Please forward this. " This post positions even the sharing of information that people think is fake as still worth it due to the impact it could have on someone's health.</p><p>We found that the sharing of information could seem useful regardless of its content because of its potential novelty, akin to fndings around how curating content can aford social status <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[93]</ref>. U10 and U11 told us how when they frst started using smartphones and WhatsApp a couple of years ago, they would immediately forward any and every message they came across. U11 described how he used to feel that it was his duty to forward information since he felt that others needed it at their disposal as well: " "I was thinking I was doing a great job forwarding all these things. Maybe I was thinking I was the only person having all this information. Some used to say, 'Boss I already have this...' Some say, 'OK thank you.' Some ask me how can I be sure whether it's true or not..." Here, we see the satisfaction associated with sharing information early on, and the perception that any information in general is useful to have. As U11 described, recipients had a variety of reactions. Other participants who noticed this type of behavior on group chats had the perception that the sender "feels they need to make an impression on a lot of people" (R13). While this was only the receiver's judgment, it indicates an association between forwards and social status.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Care Tactics</head><p>Participants had a number of strategies for resisting harmful online content, which served to re-center interdependence, combat the polarization of discriminatory misinformation, and recognize when social media is being used as a means to an end. However, we also highlight how axes of identity, in this case gender, shape the use of these methods, showing how polarization afects even eforts towards conviviality.</p><p>For many participants, speaking up about misinformation shared on their groups chats or on Facebook was a matter of responsibility, it was also in tension with the desire to not create confict. Many participants said that they would just ignore messages or posts that they thought were fake. Some even said they would delete or avoid downloading WhatsApp messages on their devices that seemed fake or were from people who often sent fake or infammatory messages. One indirect strategy was asking where a post was from, to visibilize how the source was not clear. Some participants, particularly in Miyapur, preferred confront people in person rather than online. This aforded the ability to have more meaningful conversations in a more private space. R3, a ward volunteer who informed village residents about government benefts including COVID-19 testing, explained how one person on her volunteer WhatsApp group constantly shared fake news about their jobs, such as salary raises for the additional work they were doing during the pandemic. R3 and another volunteer, their daily trip to the village council ofce, found him and told him not to send such messages. They explained that the news would come from the volunteer program and the newspaper frst if such changes were really being made, and that they were unnecessary messages on top of all the other ones in the group. R3 also discussed how gender played a role in her speaking up about misinformation online, further explaining the preference for ofine spaces: "I don't know about [refuting] directly... I mean among friends, if there are gents, we won't say directly, maybe they'll feel a certain way. This happened one to two times, I didn't say anything. To the side, we girls thought maybe this is fake news, but for us to tell them... there's nothing like that. "</p><p>Other women across rural and areas expressed similar hesitancy around refuting misinformation but also posting or sharing content in online spaces in general. R8 explained how messaging on village-wide WhatsApp groups required courage: "For village women, there's a fear that if they're overactive, it'll be a problem... I'll try to share some valuable opinions, courageously, but otherwise, we tend to think 'Why us, there's everyone else, men, more important people. '" This nuances the gendered nature of navigating misinformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[106]</ref> even women can access online spaces.</p><p>Across a few participants were much more vocal online about their concerns, particularly if they were confdent that the information was false. One reason was to send a strong message to others on the group or in their network, particularly against discriminatory perspectives. R5 recounted writing Facebook posts debunking the idea that the Nizamuddin Markaz event was intended to spread COVID-19, considering it was planned far in advance before anyone knew about the virus. Drawing on her values of social justice, she felt it was "compulsory" to discourage sharing misinformation, and if possible, ofer corrections. In other cases, particularly in Miyapur, speaking up was key to stemming the spread of rumors early. R11 recounted how someone in a village WhatsApp group forwarded rumor about how a doctor at the local hospital treated someone who later tested positive for COVID-19, and now the whole hospital had contracted it. A doctor from that hospital was in the group and was able to authoritatively say that the story was not true.</p><p>Participants also described personal experiences with spreading misinformation and the role of community in teaching them responsible practices. U10 explained how he did not realize the potential impact of indiscriminately forwarding posts when he frst started using WhatsApp, until he was taught otherwise: "A lot of people told me, hey don't do things like this, it'll cause trouble. It'll come in the news right, that if you share fake news it'll cause trouble, it has caused trouble, I saw many times in the news. Ever since then, I'll delete such things, I won't ever share them... "</p><p>A few participants noted that direct confrontations regarding potential misinformation could sometimes cause tensions in large work or community groups. Participants recounted how often, the person posting the content would apologize and delete their message, but sometimes posters would refuse to delete it, or were insistent on sharing misinformation repeatedly. These cases could cause debates within the group, and the admin had to step in and encourage constructive conversation. Posters sometimes also asked for support from the admin or left the group entirely. U10 described how group members could even send the poster's number to the admin, who would directly remove them from the group. In these examples, we see the infuence of communities, group administrators, and the news in raising awareness of misinformation, working towards a culture of more responsible sharing. However, they also present questions of how to address confict in online spaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head><p>Our fndings describe tensions in how participants aimed to use health information and social media with and for care versus the challenges presented by misinformation and the sociality of social media. We now discuss lessons learned about health information and misinformation from participants' existing eforts towards conviviality in health and communication. We then highlight the larger, institutional nature of the problem of misinformation in this context that individual eforts may not entirely address; we end with a discussion of how Illich's provocation of placing limits on industrial tools can be leveraged towards addressing misinformation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Learning from Situated Engagement with Health Information</head><p>The lens of conviviality allows us to draw out the point where tools stop serving the autonomy and creativity of individual but interrelated people, and start managing and imposing values upon people. We ask what we might learn from the frst half of the equation, that is, how people already practice creative forms of care and interdependence through health information and social media use. We discuss how our fndings motivate 1) future work on social media's role in health and wellbeing and 2) more efectively supporting media literacy for healthier online spaces.</p><p>Our fndings demonstrate a changing landscape of engagement with health via mobile phones across incomes in rural and urban areas, which present opportunities to understand the complexities of navigating this information and to support the benefts that people get out of it. One takeaway is that, in contrast to prior interventions that introduced information processes for content creation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">88]</ref>), we see greater local content creation. Though this was of mixed quality, as in the case of the Facebook post about COVID-19 and people living with HIV, we also saw examples of locally produced content supporting collective precautions and providing social commentary. The increasing use of social media and locally created content could present opportunities to understand and support the complexities of the work of local content creators, especially across health issues with varying levels of awareness and stigma. Further, we also the interest in videos and interviews with health workers, which in some cases, functioned almost as a stand in for in participants' views. With the increase in spaces for lightweight, less specialized with health workers, such as "Ask Doctor" forums <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[76]</ref>, further understanding participants' interest in accessing expertise without formal engagement could help support more of care for these contexts. Finally, we note how some participants took care to avoid sharing health information, particularly related to TCAM, where it could encroach on diverse notions of care. This mirrors prior work on understanding the internet as "space" and how this spatiality contributes to the persistence of alternative medical practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[85]</ref>. Prior work has noted how health practices, information fows, and healthcare access can difer within neighborhoods <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[52]</ref>, and if we consider the notion of spatiality online as well, it may be important to consider how information fows afect competing knowledges and uptake of various healthcare services.</p><p>There were also eforts towards conviviality in social media use that we can draw lessons from for supporting media literacy. Prior work has noted that we need to expand understandings of media literacy beyond veracity and individual interactions with information to also consider community deliberation, awareness of the problem and political economy of misinformation itself, and the many ways misinformation afects people's lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">106]</ref>. Initiatives seeking to support media literacy such as FactShala [2] have started to implement facets of this. For example, they spark discussions in communities about how misinformation afects them or ofer resources for addressing misinformation when it comes from a family member specifcally. on our fndings around how diferent participants worked towards healthier online spaces, we contribute an understanding of factors that shape the situated practice of developing literacy and combatting misinformation. Gender roles were direct factor, with in-person interactions or womenonly spaces sometimes being more comfortable for women. We also saw that ASHAs, even as trusted workers within the community, needed to navigate multiple relationships and precarity as the efects of disinformation showed up in their work. Finally, we also heard from participants about the perceived value of sharing information as new smartphone users, and how it was a social process to learn about the problem of misinformation itself and responsible sharing practices. Through this range of examples, we see that social position, community roles, and technology adoption all shape how people view and experience issues of information quality. Supporting media literacy across diferences, then, might require considering the widest impacts of misinformation and how people in particular roles may want to (or have to) address misinformation diferently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Placing Limits on Social Media</head><p>The lens of conviviality highlights how individual users can support one another in using health information towards care and navigating information responsibly. However, the context of these actions is still one of privately owned, large social media platforms and the political infuence on public health and social media content, which is what we saw contributed to aspects of overprogramming and polarization of health information. The context of plural health systems and nationalist ideologies in India demonstrates this dynamic well. We found that participants sought out information about Ayurvedic remedies, but this content could easily veer into more harmful misinformation, as in the case of pseudoscientifc COVID-19 cures detracting from other needed precautions. While participants did not communicate belief in this content, there have been accounts of negative efects of herbal remedies and sales of Ayurvedic formulations claiming to cure COVID-19 <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[54]</ref>. Further, the Indian government, politicians, and businesses have themselves suggested TCAM as cures for COVID-19 amidst signifcant criticism from the medical community and analysis that this serves as soft power for Hindu nationalist ideology <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[69]</ref>. Other misinformation has also strategically been used to blame religious minorities for the pandemic itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[4]</ref>. Meanwhile, participants in our study also mentioned advertisements on social and other media for medications that they suspected were simply scams. We see this landscape as not just a multiplicity of medical systems, but rather discourse that takes advantage of reliance on traditional medicine and hopefulness in new cures, while also feeding into political aims. to Illich's of industrial tools, it is not enough to support conviviality, we must limit tools such that imbalances like overprogramming and polarization do not erode it <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[49]</ref>. In order to do this, he argues that we must frst "demythologize" industrial tools. That is, we cannot assume that improvements expansions to tools themselves is the answer to supporting conviviality, particularly since improvements entail further dependency on the tool and on experts to make decisions about limits. Illich also suggests reframing our relationship to tools to focus on autonomous and interdependent action, rather than more democratized ownership of increasingly commodifed tools. Finally, he suggests using a participatory political process to place limits on tools. We draw on each of these themes as provocations for addressing the structural issues highlighted by the issue of health misinformation.</p><p>As indicated by calls for improved detection and greater moderation of health misinformation by social media platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">64]</ref>, platforms have an obligation to create healthier online spaces. There have been calls for more sensitive and democratic moderation, especially in cases of unsettled scientifc research, which may afect marginalized groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[63]</ref>, or in cases of disinformation campaigns where the strategic intent might be a better target for moderation than users or veracity <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[103]</ref>. However, in cases of health misinformation in India, particularly in local languages, social media have been lax on moderation, potentially due to issues of moderating across languages and political backlash as has occurred in past instances of dissenting speech <ref type="bibr">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">54]</ref>.</p><p>Given the infuence of national governments, the interests of social media platforms themselves, and the challenges of moderating large populations globally, expansion of social media to moderate itself may fall into the myth that tools can be improved, as Illich describes. Further, Illich's argument that we focus on convivial tools rather than ownership of commodifed tools brings up the question of how even participatory forms of moderation on large social media platforms will weigh in comparison to the infuence of political and private entities. Thus, questions of limiting tools and implementing political processes to decide on them seem to speak to more radical reimaginations of social media. For example, Habgood-Coote the piecemeal approach to addressing misinformation through relying on social media platforms for moderation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[43]</ref>. He asks how we might consider more solutions such as limiting tech monopolies, limiting manifestations of digital capitalism such as advertisements, and supporting greater federated ownership of social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[43]</ref>. Our fndings, as well as experiments in prior work in India <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[10]</ref>, speak to the ability of smaller communities being able to discuss misinformation, support media literacy, and bring in group administrators when needed. Placing limits on social media would also potentially divest from advertisements, corporate social media accounts, and challenges like language barriers in moderation, which has been brought up as a concern around COVID-19 misinformation on WeChat as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[75]</ref>.</p><p>Such an approach aligns with HCI research and advocacy around divesting from ads on fake news websites <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[21]</ref>, considering participatory and feminist processes in content moderation and social media interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">50]</ref>, and ways that the public can gain power platforms through data <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[111]</ref>. However, our fndings and prior work bring up questions around how such a shift might work in diverse cultural contexts. For example, there is the issue of how limits on social media do not necessarily address aspects of polarization such as gender inequities in social media participation or the creation of spaces where prejudice and discrimination can thrive (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">96]</ref>). This reinforces arguments that essential to the conversation around misinformation is supporting critical media and human rights literacy and the safety of marginalized communities in online spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[13]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>As social media becomes established as a site of consuming and sharing health information and concerns around information quality increase, it is important to understand how people perceive and share information. In this paper, we presented an interview study with participants across rural and urban South India, supplemented with analysis of social media posts shared by participants. Our fndings show the value that social media held for participants, the ways that misinformation and forms of digital capitalism introduced obstacles in online and ofine environments, and how participants created healthier online spaces. We describe takeaways for understanding health information and how people address misinformation. Drawing on Illich's recommendation of placing limits on social media and going beyond technological fxes, we consider how social media platforms, despite obligations to address misinformation, exist at the nexus of multiple institutions, exemplifed by COVID-19 misinformation in India. We end with a consideration of how alternate models of ownership might lead to relying less on social media as a service and more on interrelation among people.</p></div>			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">The name of the village and all participants in this paper have been anonymized.</note>
