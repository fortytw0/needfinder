<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Smart homes continue to raise concerns about privacy and encroachment of businesses into intimate spaces. Prior research has focused on families and device owners in western contexts (Europe and North America), and has identified the importance of bystanders: individuals who are subjected to smart device use of others. Given the cultural and contextual aspects of accommodating bystanders, we identify a gap where bystanders in non-western societies have been insufficiently researched.</p><p>To address this we conduct 20 interviews with domestic workers and household employers in Jordan, exploring privacy attitudes and practices. Our analysis uncovers a complex interplay between religious and social norms; legal and regulatory perspectives on privacy; and tensions between households and their domestic workers. We explore issues arising from smart homes coexisting as a residence and workplace, and highlight how workplace protections are ill-suited. We structure our findings to help inform public awareness, policy makers, manufacturers, and future research.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>about privacy and security, including for example issues surrounding consent practices for data collection and use (e.g. dark patterns and persuasive design practices to gain consent), how personal data is protected by companies and third parties (e.g. smart CCTV or nanny-cams being breached to stream video outside the home), or even how smart technology can be misused by users against other members of the same household (e.g. intimate partner or domestic abuse). This is further complicated by the fact that homes are private spaces in which the privacy rights of smart home users and bystanders are not clearly established, and also where culturally and socially acceptable privacy norms and practices are continually evolving in the face of highly innovative and changeable technology.</p><p>The vast majority of privacy research in the smart home has focused on western contexts (e.g., Europe, and North America) however, as smart technology becomes more ubiquitous, we argue that non-western perspectives have been overlooked and require close attention in order to provide more suitable privacy solutions that fit the contextual needs more closely. In this paper, we report on the results of a qualitative study aimed at exploring the privacy concerns of domestic workers in smart homes in Jordan, which is a country that has a middle-eastern social norms and a moderate Islamic background <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. We have examined smart homes to explore privacy attitudes and practices, focusing on public awareness of smart devices, worker privacy concerns and expectations, aspirations for privacy control in smart homes, perceptions and expectations of privacy rights, and contextual influences (i.e., social norms, customs, and religious background).</p><p>We interviewed a total of 8 families ("employers"), and 12 domestic workers ("workers") from Jordan using semi-structured interviews, which we then translated, transcribed, and analysed using Grounded Theory. We identified 5 themes: a) Weak public awareness of smart technologies and basic understanding of user privacy in the smart home; b) Privacy concerns, and expectations -highlighting that cameras are reported to be the most concerning devices; c) Perceptions that worker privacy rights are limited and power dynamics between workers and employers are asymmetric, which leaves workers with no choice other than accepting situations where employers use smart devices to monitor them; d) Contextual, social, and religious influences on privacy concerns, practices and rights; and e) Aspirations for innovative privacy control features to compensate for perceived problems with existing solutions. The paper concludes with some recommendations to mitigate the impact of smart home devices on bystander privacy in Jordan and similar contexts, and discusses future research avenues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK</head><p>This research study has been conducted in the middle eastern country of Jordan. The Jordanian constitution declares Islam <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> as the country's official religion, and the country is considered a moderate Muslim country.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Definitions</head><p>for clarity, we highlight here the definitions of some key terms that we will use in this paper: Smart Device: Drawing from existing definitions in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">94]</ref>, a smart device is a controllable device that is equipped with an embedded processor, memory, sensors, and a network connection to connect to other devices or to the internet to provide useful services to the users and can store or share data on a local storage-device or over the internet.</p><p>Smart Home: Drawing on existing defnitions in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20]</ref>, a smart home is a dwelling that is equipped with smart devices that provide the inhabitants with useful services and benefits. The smart devices in the smart home can connect to other devices and/or to the internet and can be either locally or remotely accessed, controlled and/or monitored, and can collect, store, or share data on local storage device or over the internet.</p><p>Smart Home Bystanders: We will use the definition by Yao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">[107]</ref> which states that "smart home bystanders refer to people who do not own or directly use the smart devices, but they are potentially involved in the use of smart home devices, such as other family members who do not purchase the devices, guests, tenants, passersby". Under this definition, we assume that the smart home bystanders can be subject to data collection, and they may not be aware of the installed smart devices, or the functions of these devices. In this paper, we will focus on domestic workers as a group representing smart home bystanders and we may use the term "workers" to refer to this users group.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">General Overview</head><p>Smart devices can collect sensitive information from the context of the smart home all the time, which raises concerns about residents' privacy and security. Some risks arising from this include misuse of data, data leakage, cyber-attacks using compromised devices, burglary facilitated from compromised devices, and many more associated threats. Such risks are further exacerbated as many residents are not aware of the security and privacy consequences of smart devices, and the devices themselves are prone to significant usability issues that can hinder the efforts made by the inhabitants to protect their security and privacy <ref type="bibr">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">109]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Smart Homes</head><p>The ubiquity of smart home devices and platforms has enabled applications that adapt to user's preferences and interests. Smart devices are either standalone devices that connect to the internet through existing Wi-fi networks, or devices that communicate to the internet using a bridge, like Z-Wave and Zigbee. There are two main types of smart home platforms: Hubs, such as Samsung Smart Things <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[109]</ref>, Vera [17], and Wink <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>. These are central devices that are designed to be used to communicate with and control other smart devices. Similar to hubs, smart personal assistants, such as Google Home and Amazon Echo/Alexa, can communicate with other smart devices, allowing users to use predefined controllers to control their smart home devices. The second type, instead of using a central hub, makes use of cloud-hosted services to enable the control of devices. This is accessed via a variety of means e.g. web browsers, smartphone applications, or any applications that conform to the service API.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Privacy</head><p>According to the Oxford English Dictionary, Privacy is the state of being alone and not watched or interrupted by other people [13]. Altman's theory of boundary <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref> states that privacy is a temporal dynamic process of interpersonal boundary: a process for regulating interactions with others which indicates how open or closed we are in response to changes in our internal states and external conditions. Due to the proliferation of smart-home devices, surveillance cameras and other smart devices have become expected devices in many environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">51]</ref> which in turn has driven a number of privacy concerns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.4.1</head><p>Brief History of Privacy. In 1891, Warren and Brandeis <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[101]</ref> published their seminal work 'The Right to Privacy', where they argued about protecting oneself from others. In 1967, Westin <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[102]</ref> published 'Privacy and freedom' where he defined privacy in terms of self-determination: "privacy is the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is shared with others". There is a strong relationship between privacy and technology evolution, as seen for example in the privacy concerns arising in the late 19th century from the use of cameras in public, which continues to this day shaping discussion about data use and concerns arising from the proliferation of smart devices.</p><p>2.4.2 Privacy Design. Privacy in the context of smart homes has been tackled from two angles: the first by focusing on the home, its inner workings and the norms, practices and values of inhabitants; and the second by focusing on the smart devices, their technical capabilities, design characteristics, and data flows. Bridging these two perspectives, the theory of Contextual Integrity (CI) <ref type="bibr">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> argues that privacy is dependent on context, which consists of two norms: the norm of appropriate data collection, and the norm of appropriate data flow. A privacy breach is considered to have occurred when either of the two norms is broken.</p><p>This perspective shows the importance of understanding privacy norms in context and prior research has aimed to do this. Apthorpe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[30]</ref> studied privacy norms in smart homes as a whole unit, with the aim to support designing new smart devices that users want to buy and feel secure using in their homes. On the device level, Lau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[64]</ref> studied voice assistants, focussing on the privacy concerns of bystanders arising from the actions of device owners. They recommended new design features to improve privacy with smart speakers such as guest mode or a voice command mute option. Yao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[106]</ref> studied both device owners and the bystander concerns to incorporate them in the design process and discussed how future practitioners and researchers can incorporate the findings in privacy designs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Smart Home Privacy Concerns</head><p>Brush et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[37]</ref>, Worthy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[104]</ref>, and Choe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref> identified concerns about security and privacy risks from smart homes. further findings from research of smart home platforms and devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> have identified vulnerabilities in both smart home platforms and devices, for example enabling smart TVs to record conversations <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[103]</ref>.</p><p>User perceptions and concerns of smart devices have been studied in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">72]</ref>. Naeini et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[80]</ref> found that privacy perceptions are dependent on the context. In particular, users perceive data collection in public environments as less critical, and also consider environmental data as less critical than personal data. Also, Naeini et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">112]</ref> found that users may compromise privacy for perceived benefits when consenting to data sharing. This was confirmed by Zheng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[112]</ref>. Also, Zeng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[109]</ref> found that smart homeowners in general are not concerned about potential threats. Rodden et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[90]</ref> found that users have low concerns about data content, and instead are strongly concerned about the processing of their own data. Another study also showed that lay smart homeowners were not able to state specific threats of sharing their own data <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53]</ref>.</p><p>In general, smart homeowners need to be aware of the potential threats in order to be motivated to configure their smart devices to match their privacy requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[93]</ref>. Several studies have shown that smart homeowners prefer to be aware of the data collected about them <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">80]</ref>. from another perspective, Tabassum et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[98]</ref> confirmed that smart homeowners were uncertain about how their data is used, and they expressed a wish for more transparency and control. Another study by Baldini et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[31]</ref> showed that owners are keen to be informed about the smart device's privacy aspects before purchase. from a smart device perspective, the concerns about smart TVs have been studied by Ghiglieri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> who found that users are not aware of the data collected by smart TVs, and that when they were informed, they disconnected their smart TV from the network. Abdi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[24]</ref> found that some smart speaker users do not use the full functionality of the device as a result of privacy concerns as they do not want these devices to collect more information about them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Bystander Privacy Concerns with the Smart-Home</head><p>Smart devices are integrated in the smart home social and economic context in a way that makes it difficult to figure out whether these devices are collecting information about residents and bystanders. This unfiltered collection of data is threatening the privacy of these affected populations, particularly bystanders. In many cases, bystanders are not aware of the existence or functions of the smart devices. for example, children in the home can be considered bystanders from a data collection point of view, for example where smart toys <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">74]</ref> are bought and configured without children's awareness of what these devices are, nor what they are doing. Some studies have also explored visitor concerns with shared housing (e.g. AirBnB rentals) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">66]</ref>. Other research is highlighting a greater awareness of the importance of bystanders <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">85]</ref>. Bernd et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[33]</ref> discussed the impact of smart devices on domestic workers (i.e., nannies) in a western context, and in earlier work <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[34]</ref> discussed that many researchers e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">97]</ref> have proposed several solutions to privacy challenges in smart environments, such as: a) disclosure of the installed smart devices and their functions, b) improving control mechanisms, and c) adopting conservative defaults. However,the challenge remains significant when we consider that bystanders may not know about the existence of a smart device, may not know what it is doing, and that privacy control mechanisms are largely designed for the use of device administrators and not for random bystanders. Ahmad et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[25]</ref> argued that smart devices should be designed in a way that clearly and unambiguously conveys sensor states to people around them and make actionable design recommendations to provide strong privacy assurances to bystanders. Marky et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[71]</ref> discussed that visitors cannot protect their privacy in a foreign smart environment due to poor awareness of privacy violations by smart devices, a lack of knowledge, or a lack of coping strategies. from this, they outlined five steps for visitors to exert control over their privacy: 1) gaining awareness, 2) gaining knowledge, 3) evaluating data sensitivity, 4) decision making, and 5) decision communication. Given the variety of challenges in this space, it is particularly important to understand the context of use of smart devices, and to understand people's expectations and interests in order to design effective privacy protection mechanisms <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Many privacy researchers are working to build a shared knowledge base of smart home devices such as how users understand device functionality, or user expectations in addition to privacy concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">109]</ref>. Asymmetries in people's knowledge and experiences, together with the power dynamics between different user groups can produce a variety of privacy impacts in the context of smart homes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">84]</ref>. flechais and Kraemer <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> argued that the control over smart devices is related to socio-cultural dynamics. These issues also extend into more nefarious scenarios, where having control over smart-home devices is an element in domestic abuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">67]</ref>. Many researchers have argued that people's concerns about security and privacy in the smart home context are dependent on contextual and situational factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">80]</ref>, and people are more concerned about data collection in their homes rather than in their work spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[80]</ref>.</p><p>Bystander privacy can be breached by smart home devices that collect data from the environment but has also been studied in different emerging technologies, such as wearable cameras <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">86]</ref>, and augmented reality <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">46]</ref>. These studies found that bystanders would share information if they could exert control over it, and that privacy concerns about the smart device are dependent on the context: whether it is a private or public space, e.g. using the smart device inside a house or in a metro station. Another study found that users aim to protect the privacy of bystanders <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[86]</ref>, and there are clear indications that the cultural context plays an important role.</p><p>Contextual Integrity (CI) researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">81]</ref> have studied people's multi-context privacy concerns, and have investigated people's view of smart home devices based -in some cases -on privacy norms in smart homes vs other contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">103]</ref>. Researchers found that different contexts overlapping can produce new concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref>. Other studies have investigated bystanders' concerns with smart devices to examine the influence of contextual factors (i.e., purposes, mechanisms, and bystanders' ability to control data collection) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">89,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">89,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">95,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">96]</ref>.</p><p>More research has focused on the privacy concerns of smart home owners and their families <ref type="bibr">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">108]</ref> and several studies have addressed multi-user scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">108,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">110,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">111]</ref>, however not much work has addressed smart home bystanders <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">99]</ref>. Chhetri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref> discussed that the greatest user concerns with the smart devices are: a) Tracking of users, their actions and preferences, b) Storage of conversations and their transcripts (for audio conversations) in the cloud, c) The lack of security of such content in the cloud, d) The potential for private conversations to be hacked, and e) The likelihood of such information to be subject to legal discovery by law enforcement and eventually disclosed publicly. On the other hand. Yao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[106]</ref> argued that the complex context of smart homes, the social relationships, and power dynamics can complicate privacy aspects. Their study showed that the majority of smart home design tends to protect smart homes owners and their families, with some designs aimed to protect the privacy of bystanders. Other studies showed that some users would like to have a visitor mode of smart devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">41]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7">Privacy in Non-Western and Muslim Contexts</head><p>The vast majority of privacy research has focused on western contexts with very little research exploring non-western contextsspecifically Muslim contexts. Researchers have argued that the notion of privacy varies substantially across cultures, times, and locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">92]</ref> suggesting that outcomes of privacy research conducted in western contexts cannot simply be applied as-is to non-western contexts. Ahmed et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[26]</ref> highlighted the social and cultural factors that impact privacy of populations who practice mobile device sharing in the non-western Muslim context of Bangladesh.</p><p>Mustafa et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[79]</ref> argued that understanding Muslim identity is particularly of great importance as, according to the Pew research centre, Islam is the world's second-largest religious tradition after Christianity, which makes it imperative for the HCI community to consider privacy concerns of Muslim populations with smart technologies. Norwawi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[82]</ref> argued that the human rights recognized in modern constitutions, charters and international treaties are embedded in the religion of Islam, as respect for life, privacy, freedom, equality, property and religious belief are an essential features of Islam. Despite the limited amount of research in this space, the ArabHCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[29]</ref> initiative has aimed at tackling HCI issues from a Muslim perspective. In particular, this initiative has emerged to address the misrepresentation of these populations in HCI research, highlighting the fact that Western based research outcomes require delicate adaptations to suit non-Western contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHODOLOGY AND RESEARCH QUESTION</head><p>With approval from the University of Oxford Central University Research Ethics Committee (CUREC) [Approval: CS-C1A-21-001], we have designed and conducted structured interviews with 8 families and 12 domestic workers (nurses, care givers, nannies, babysitters, and in-home maintenance workers). This research project was conducted to address the research question "What are the privacy concerns of the households and their domestic workers (i.e., the bystanders) in the smart homes in Jordan?". Fig- <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (next page) shows the research process and the applied methodology. Since there has been relatively little research exploring the privacy concerns of domestic workers and their employer families in non-western contexts, we chose to use Grounded Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> as a data analysis method for our research study because it has shown to be a well-established methodology for exploring security and privacy, and is particularly suited to areas of inquiry that have not been widely researched.</p><p>Through a structured process of data collection, data coding and inductive reasoning, Grounded Theory can be used to construct substantive explanatory theories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Recruitment and Sampling</head><p>We recruited participants by posting on specialized social media groups (e.g. Babysitters Amman, Baby sitting in Jordan, Nurses in Jordan, and Ask Jordan), by directly contacting recruitment agencies, by directly contacting smart device sellers, and by snowball sampling after the candidates agree to share their contact details with us. We asked volunteers to fill a demographic and basic information survey. In the survey we provided a general description of the study, and we asked the participants whether they would like to participate. Those who accepted were asked about their age, gender, household location, education level, purpose of using smart devices, experience with smart homes, employment details, marital status, whether they are an employer or a domestic worker, and to provide their contact details for future communication with the researchers.</p><p>27 people filled the survey. After screening the survey results, we identified 20 eligible participants who met our criteria:</p><p>• Age should be over 18 years.</p><p>• To consent to participating in the interviews.</p><p>• To have experience with smart homes and smart devices.</p><p>• To be able to give the consent to being audio-recorded. We managed to recruit and interview 8 individuals who were members of different employer families and 12 workers from different households, see Fig- <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2, and Table-1</ref> (next page). We refer to the workers and families in the interview transcripts as PW and PE respectively (e.g., PE01 refers to family number 1, and PW01 refers to worker number 1). We explicitly avoided including workers and family members from the same household to avoid any negative effects arising from socio-economic power dynamics, and to enable participants to communicate openly. All participants who met the criteria were contacted to set a date and time for an online interview. The interviews were conducted using Zoom and Facebook Messenger, and we used standalone recording devices to audio record the interviews.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Interviews</head><p>We designed semi-structured interviews using Grounded Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref>, and informed from the literature review in order to help identify potential topics of interest. Prior to the real interviews, we conducted 4 pilot interviews to test for clarity of the questions.</p><p>Adjustments were done based on the results of the pilot interviews. The pilot interviews were not included in the analysis of the research study. We transcribed and analyzed all the 20 interviews using Grounded Theory procedure <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. The Grounded Theory has helped us examining bystanders privacy concerns with smart homes, and understanding deeply the many issues around research topic. The Grounded Theory has helped us understanding people's behaviors and attitudes, through examining both rational and irrational aspects of behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[105]</ref>. In the beginning of each interview, we described the research topic and asked participants to give us their permission to start the interview and to audio record it. We assured the participants that all their individual identifiable information would be kept confidential and would not be shared with any party, and we assured them that all identifiable information would be deleted after we finished the analysis of the interview transcripts. The interviews lasted between 30 to 91 minutes with an average of 41 minutes for all interviews, 35 minutes for the workers' interviews, and 52 minutes for the family interviews. We began with general questions to gather information about the participants' background, experiences, how they view and understand smart homes and smart devices, and about the relations between the families and the workers. After these warm-up questions, we went through more detailed questions, being careful not to interrupt the participants and trying to avoid influencing them or their answers.</p><p>The interviews were conducted in English with participants who could speak English language proficiently, and in Arabic with those who were not able to speak English. The main researcher translated the Arabic interviews and made efforts to avoid altering or making any changes to the participants' comments during the translations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Analysis</head><p>After transcribing the interviews, we used the inductive grounded theory approach to analyze the transcripts. The primary researcher conducted, transcribed and translated the interviews, and performed the initial coding of all interview transcripts. Then two researchers grouped the codes into themes (axial coding) and categories (selective coding). We observed data saturation between the 19th and the 20th interview; (i.e., no significant new codes emerged in interviews 19-20).</p><p>After we completed our initial analysis (see Appendix-B), we tested the codes and themes for reliability and credibility. We used the grounded theory triangulation method by selecting randomly 7 participants (i.e., 4 workers, and 3 families) and asked them to comment on the generated codes and themes and to determine whether they agreed with the analysis output. We found consensus between the participants on the generated codes and themes. Some additional codes were identified and added to the code-book as a result of the verification process, but the new codes did not generate new themes and were linked to the existing themes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RESEARCH FINDINGS AND RESULTS</head><p>The study focused on the privacy of populations in the smart homes, specifically domestic workers and employer families in smart homes in Jordan. The study showed that families use different types of smart devices such as security systems, smart cameras, smart speakers, and smart lights. Using the Grounded Theory approach described above, we used NVivo 12 Pro to code the interview transcripts and we identified 220 codes (see Appendix-B) which we organised into themes. In the following sections we will explain the identified themes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Themes</head><p>We identified 5 themes that are summarized in Table-4, and Fig- <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. The identified 5 themes are: a) Weak public awareness of smart technologies, b) Privacy concerns, and expectations, where we found that cameras are the most concerning devices, c) Perceptions of Privacy rights, and expectations, where we highlighted the   Weak Public Awareness of Smart Homes. When we asked participants about how they understand smart homes and smart devices, they were not able to demonstrate a strong understanding of the technology; most of the answers focused on the names and brands of the technology, with some discussion of the functionality. Only one participant mentioned that they had read the documentation and had also contacted the vendor to understand more about how to use their smart speaker (an Amazon Alexa). Most of the participants said that they do not have a clear idea about where the data is stored: some of them thought it was stored on a local hard drive inside the device, and others mentioned that they had never thought about that, but they thought the data might be stored over the cloud. PE05 said: "I think the data is stored on a small chip inside the devices, and really, I do not know. Maybe it is online. I have never thought about that".</p><p>When we asked participants about how they understand privacy in the smart home, most of them said that it is mainly about audio and/or video recording them while they are inside the home, and none mentioned other types of data the smart devices might be collecting bout them (e.g., attendance patterns, daily activities, personal habits, voice print, etc.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>.</p><p>Weak Competence of Managing Smart Devices. When we asked participants about how long data is stored for, most of them did not know. PE01 said: "I do not know, but may be they store the data for 372 days". And when we asked them what vendors might be doing with their data, and how they could use it, the majority said they do not know, although a few of them mentioned that vendors could use it for advertisement, and some of them mentioned that nobody can access their data or use it. PE08 said: "Yes, I think they use it for advertisement". When we asked participants about whether devices are connected to the internet, most of them said yes, and when we asked them about who can access the data and view logs, most of them said family members can. PW07 said: "Only the family and the experts from the company can access the data". None of the interviewed workers or families said that workers can access the data. However, most of them said that workers can use the smart devices.</p><p>Limited Role of Recruitment Agencies in Raising Awareness About Smart Technologies. We found that participants use recruitment agencies to help them with their recruitment and employment needs, and when we asked participants whether recruitment agencies or public organizations provide any information about smart devices, most said that agencies do not provide any kind of information. Two participants mentioned that agencies had informed them that the homes they are going to work in might have smart devices like cameras and smart speakers without giving them additional details. Some participants mentioned that sometimes the recruitment poster mentioned that the home has smart devices. Additionally, it was interesting to note that some domestic workers share information on specialized social web pages about the homes they have worked for before, thus, new workers could know whether the homes they are going to work in have smart devices or not, and what type of devices are used. PW12 said:" Not exactly, but they told us that there will be smart devices in the homes that we will be working in, and in some cases when I get my job directly through an advert, some times that advert says clearly that there are cameras or smart devices, and on the other side, we -as a group of care givers-we tell each other about the homes that we have worked in before, and whether they use smart devices or not, so the worker who will be going to that home, will be aware of the smart devices, and will take care and behave in good manner".</p><p>When we asked participants whether the recruitment agencies got involved in the worker-employer contract negotiations, and specifically about issues related to smart home and using smart devices in the home, all participants said agencies do not get involved in such negotiations. PW12 said: "No, they do not get involved in contract negotiation in general.". And when we asked participants whether they thought it would be good if agencies provided information and advice about smart devices to families and workers, they all approved of the idea. PW06 said: "It would be good if they tell us about the smart devices and how to deal with them". People are Mostly Concerned about Audio/Visual Data Collection The analysis has shown that Audio/Visual data collection is the most concerning function of smart devices. PW06 said: "I am concerned about posting video or audio file about me on social media. ". We also found that people are concerned about data collection inside the home more than in their workplace. PW12 said: "No, as this is my workplace and I have to respect its rules". This makes the smart home an interesting environment given it is both a home (for employers) and a workplace (for domestic workers). We also asked participants what kind of smart devices are most used in the home, all participants commented that cameras are used the most; PE05 said: "I use cameras to check on my mom". In reviewing this finding, we suspect that the responses were primed due to the earlier question about privacy concerns, and it is likely that the question was interpreted as "what kind of privacy concerning devices are most used in the home". from the perspective of workers, some thought that they were the primary targets of smart devices data collection, while others did not feel targeted and considered themselves as bystanders to these smart devices. When we asked whether workers know if they are monitored, PW08 said: "Yes, I know", while PW10 said: "They do not use them to monitor me". When we asked participants about how they understand privacy in the smart home, many of them gave answers around the idea of not being monitored and recorded, and not to share data about them on social media. PE01 said: "for me, the privacy is not to send anything about us as a family outside the home without our knowledge or consent, or to post anything about us on the social media".</p><p>Impact of the Workers on family's Privacy. Both families and workers mentioned that family privacy is impacted by the existence of the domestic workers in the home. PE07 said: "Of course. The presence of domestic workers in the home is squeezing our privacy and sometimes we do not feel comfortable about that situation".</p><p>Smart Devices Drive Workers to Adopt Disciplined Practices. Most of the participants said that workers' performance had been improved and that they had become more responsible and more productive as a result of being monitored and recorded all the time. PW12 said: "I do my best to do everything perfectly, and to be honest without camera I may not do my job in that perfect way". Other workers said that they did not feel that their performance had been changed. PW06 said: "Not really, the family trust is the most important factor for me".</p><p>Workers Should Respect the Rules of the Blended Context of the Home. When we asked participants about the difference between the home and the workplace for domestic workers, they said that their home is a blended context of a workplace for the workers and a home for the families, and workers have to respect the rules of the home. PE03 said: "They are different, as for me I go and stay for a few hours in my workplace, and I have to respect the rules of my workplace. The same for the domestic worker, my home is her workplace, and she has to respect the rules of her workplace (my home) if it contradicts with her privacy rights".</p><p>Family members or Vendor staff manage the smart devices, and the collected data. When we asked participants about who controlled the smart devices and managed the collected data, families said one or more of the family members do. Workers said they do not know exactly who does that, but they think that one of the family members does. PW06 said: "The family do". Some participants said the device vendor's employees might do as well. PE01: "According to amazon privacy rights, it is only us and amazon developers after we grant them our permission to do so. " When we asked participants about whether families inform workers about smart devices, some families said that they assume workers are aware of the smart devices. PE03 said: "No, she has to know because everything is in the house".</p><p>Perception of Distrusting Workers. Some workers said that the lack of disclosure of the smart devices is a clear sign that families do not trust them. PW12 said: "Because they do not trust us as a stranger in the house, as they do not know us, they want to be more careful about their families and homes".</p><p>Families Do Not Inform Workers About Devices. The analysis has shown that some families do not inform workers about the smart devices. PE03 said: "We did not inform her. " Families Have Concerns with Informing Workers about the Smart Devices. When we asked families about the reasons that prevent them from informing the workers about the smart devices, some of them said that they feel it is risky to inform them as they might quit job or create problems when they know about the devices. PE03 said: "Yes, maybe she will break some of them or make a problem, she may misuse them. ".  Family's Autocracy. The analysis has shown that some families have an autocratic attitude concerning what should happen inside their homes, as these families think that their home is their own territory where they can do whatever they wish. Those families think that they do not have to inform workers about smart devices that are collecting data about them, nor do they need to request workers permissions to monitor and record them. PE05 said: "It is my home, my territory, and the worker is coming to live with me or to visit me, she has to adapt to my rules. Her privacy should not affect my desire to feel secure in my home".</p><p>Perception of Disrespecting Workers' Privacy Rights. Some workers said that the lack of disclosure of the smart devices is a clear sign that families do not respect their rights, but they have to accept that and to give up their privacy rights as they need to retain their jobs. PW02 said: "In most cases and in general they do not respect the privacy of anyone inside their homes, as they believe people do not have any rights inside their home. "</p><p>Perceptions of Privacy Rights. We have identified several conflicting views relating to the perception of privacy rights for workers in smart homes. Some families thought that it is the family's right to monitor people inside their own home. PE05 said: "No, I think it is always the right of the place owner to use any type of smart devices. If they are not ok with them, they can simply leave the place". Other families believed that families did not have the right to monitor workers without informing them and requesting their permission. PE01 said: "It is not their right in my opinion". Workers, on the other hand, strongly believed that families should inform workers about the devices, and should request their permission. PW06 said: "They should ask for the permission from the workers".</p><p>The analysis has also shown that some workers have adopted compensatory reactions to protect their privacy. One participant mentioned that she habitually placed her scarf on the cameras, and another worker mentioned that she would sit in some corners in the house to avoid the recording. PW01 said: "Yeah my scarf. I put on the camera to prevent the recording", PW05 said: "I managed to solve it by avoiding sitting close to them inside the home, same for the speakers". Additionally, some employers mentioned that cameras could be used to show what happened when there are any incidents, PE08 said: "Legally they can be used to protect them, especially of there is a problem and someone needs to sue others in the court". We note that while this view was expressed by employers, it is very unclear whether and under what circumstances an employee could gain access to a recording on an employers' device.</p><p>Finally, our analysis shows that some families inform workers about smart devices and also allow them to use the devices, such as smart speakers, smart lights, and smart windows. PE05: "Yes, she knows everything, and she uses the smart devices to help her with the daily works".</p><p>Absence of Privacy Rights and Policies in Jordan. We found that our participants did not think that Jordan has regulations or policies that address privacy rights in smart homes. PW05 said: "No idea. I do not think they even exist". Most of families said that they did not consider privacy rights before buying and installing smart devices and they never had thought about that. PW11 said: "No, I never thought about them". And when we asked participants whether work contracts have any articles about privacy rights, all of them said there is nothing about privacy rights in the work contracts. PE02 said: "No. There is nothing about privacy in the contract".</p><p>Power Dynamics and User Agency. The analysis has shown the power dynamics between employers and workers are such that workers frequently give up their privacy rights in favor of other perceived benefits, such as safety, security, convenience, and to retain their jobs. PW09 said:"Sometimes, I agree with families on not using the cams, and sometimes they do not accept. In the end I have to adapt as this is my job" This is consistent with what flechais and Kraemer <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> have discussed in their work on smart home families, where power dynamics and user agency <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[78]</ref> strongly influence awareness of how devices work, competence levels, and gaining permission to access the devices. Our finding also aligns with the work of Geen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[52]</ref>, who found that power imbalances among smart home users reduce user agency.</p><p>Trust Vendors' Privacy Policies. When we asked participants about whether they trusted the vendor privacy policies, they expressed a broad sense of trust. PE01 said: "As per amazon, privacy is protected. But Alexa is turned on 24/7, and I have my doubts that Alexa can listen to us without our knowledge". Religious Background and Social Dynamics Drive Positive Privacy Practices. We found that the religious background, social norms, and customs of Jordan were raised as motivating some positive privacy practices such as urging families to treat workers well. PE05 said: "Yes. I am religious person, I believe, I must inform her and respect her privacy".</p><p>We asked participants about the differences between visitors and domestic workers in their homes, and whether they would inform them about the installed smart devices. Some participants demonstrated a clear difference in the standing of workers and guests, saying that they would not inform workers, but they would inform visitors. This was because they felt that the social dynamics involved with having visitors would drive them to inform visitors about smart devices and also to respect visitors' privacy rights. PE04 said: "The visitor may become upset if we do not tell him, but the worker is paid to do his job and he must accept that we are protecting our home" Religious Background, Social Norms, and Customs Influence Privacy Concerns, Practices, Expectations, and Rights. We found that some privacy concerns are influenced by the religious background of the person, like for example, some female workers mentioned that they do not accept to be monitored, or video recorded without their hijab (head covering). PW01 said: "It does not feel good that they [the family] may see me when I change my clothes, or take off my hijab so I need to be careful. ".</p><p>Religious Background is Presumed to Ensure Privacy Rights. We have found that many participants believe that Islam ensures privacy rights, that a committed Muslim person will adhere to Islam's statutes and will respect privacy of others, and that Islam also urges people to build good relationships with others and to trust each others. PW03 said: "The family always tell me, they are religious people, and will not hurt you". PE07 said: "We can not hide devices from her, it is forbidden in our religion".  To Improve and Ensure Awareness of Smart Devices in the Home. When we asked participants about whether they think novel technology could be used to improve the design of the smart devices to protect bystander's privacy in smart homes, most of them expressed a wish-list of privacy control features that could be adopted to protect people's privacy. PE02 said: "Maybe we can use a secret word or something like that and maybe a mechanism to ask the device owner whether to record the new user or not, or through facial gestures, I mean through a certain mechanism".</p><p>Novel Applications could Utilize Recognition Technologies. Some participants mentioned that recognition technologies could be used to improve the design of smart devices to help people enjoy the smart devices benefits, and to protect privacy at the same time by excluding identified individuals from data collection or use. PE01 said: "I think by using voice recognition, and facial recognition".</p><p>Concerns With Novel Applications. Some participants mentioned that new privacy protections could jeopardize the safety, security, and privacy of people in the smart home. PE01 said: "No, they may hide themselves from the devices, and conduct crimes, and they should not be given any ability to hide themselves from the devices. I think this may jeopardize the home security".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 5.1 Summary of findings</head><p>We have identified 5 themes about smart home bystander privacy concerns and expectations in Jordan. The findings showed weak awareness of smart technologies and privacy rights, basic understanding of privacy, cameras are the most concerning devices, lack of data protection and privacy regulations in Jordan, impact of asymmetric power dynamics and user agency, influence of social norms and religious background on privacy concerns, expectations, and rights, and it uncovered some user aspirations for privacy control in future smart home devices.</p><p>The findings and recommendations of this study resonate with the outcomes of prior research studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">82]</ref>, which have shown weak public awareness of smart technologies and the implications on people's privacy, the exigent demand for privacy research to address non-western contexts-specifically Muslim contexts, and the roles of policymakers and public awareness entities in improving the privacy protection of smart home bystanders.</p><p>Despite the fact that this study focuses on Jordan, we believe that the elicited outcomes and recommendations are applicable to some extent to other contexts in the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa) where these share similar social norms, customs, and religious background. future research to address other MENA regions is needed to either confirm the outcomes of this study and/or present new findings and recommendations that are applicable in other MENA contexts, and also to explore whether these findings also apply to expatriate or other communities that live in foreign countries but share Jordanian social and religious customs and norms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Recommendations for Public Awareness</head><p>To improve public awareness of smart technologies, privacy understanding, and privacy rights in Jordan, we recommend that government and public awareness organizations and related entities should collaborate to increase public awareness by: a) Conducting public awareness campaigns about smart technologies, b) Developing information booklet guides about using smart technologies in the home and its potential impact on people's privacy, c) Developing information materials and guidance for recruitment agencies, professional associations, and other concerned stakeholders on how to improve positive privacy practices, and e) To agree on a common public understanding of privacy in smart homes for different stakeholders, especially the smart home bystanders.</p><p>We believe that improving awareness of smart technologies among populations would help people mitigating privacy threats and improve privacy protection. It would also help in facilitating privacy-related discussions between employers and workers to resolve conflicts and mitigate impacts of families autocracy, and by explicitly raising awareness of privacy rights of domestic workers, may help address the asymmetric power dynamics between these different groups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Recommendations for Policymakers</head><p>The lack of privacy regulations in Jordan is opening smart homes to asymmetric power dynamics between families and workers and also has a limiting effect on user agency given that there is a lack of clarity around what is acceptable and what is not. We recommend that policymakers and concerned entities need to consider bystander privacy concerns in future privacy and regulations in Jordan, and to consider and leverage social norms during the development of future regulations.</p><p>It is useful to highlight that the Jordanian government is adopting a draft bill in favor of issuing new data protection rights based on the European GDPR <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. It is expected the new Jordanian data protection regulations will be issued in the near future <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>. It is not clear on whether the new regulations will address user privacy rights in the smart home and similar spaces, however we do not expect the new regulations to do so. Another relevant law is the Jordanian Cybercrime law [3, 9], which has an ambiguous definition of "hate speech," defined as "every writing and every speech or action intended to provoke sectarian or racial sedition, advocate violence or foster conflict between followers of different religions and various components of the nation.". This can be interpreted to apply to online content regardless of whether it is intended to incite hatred or harm, or even represents a threat. Taken one step further, this could play a role in any privacy conflict between user groups in the smart homes, and it remains to be seen how this would be used by lawyers and prosecutors. finally, the Jordanian labour law [10] has no specific articles that discuss and address working in smart space and privacy rights of workers existing in such environments, and it is not clear whether smart homes are considered domestic or workplaces.</p><p>While the role of religion in setting policy goals is debated, it is important to note that the religion of Islam <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">82]</ref> is being used to justify certain privacy attitudes and practices, and Islam places a strong emphasis on the importance of human rights in supporting the well-being and personal growth of every individual in civilized societies. Norwawi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[82]</ref> argued that the human rights recognized in modern constitutions, charters and international treaties are embedded in the religion of Islam, as respect for life, privacy, freedom, equality, property and religious belief are an essential features of Islam. Based on the above discussion, Muslim societies in general are expected to respect privacy rights.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Recommendations for Smart Device Designers</head><p>Our Such aspirations are indicative of the need for more innovation and contextual awareness of the needs of bystanders for designers of smart devices, and the specific aspirations of workers and families of Jordanian smart homes are a useful inspiration for innovations that would be suitable to a wider middle eastern context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">LIMITATIONS</head><p>The interviews were conducted in English and Arabic. While some of the participants were non-native English or Arabic speakers, 18 participants were comfortable making the interviews in English or Arabic, however 2 participants did not find it easy to communicate in either language and we communicated as best we could. Given the difficulties in establishing a good communication, it is possible that we have missed some points about privacy concerns, power dynamics, user agency, and other issues from those two participants.</p><p>In addition to language barriers, our participants' did not have a strong awareness of smart devices, data handling, data security, and of privacy issues in smart homes, and as a result were not able to provide detailed answers to a number of more specific topics.</p><p>Finally, in common with other qualitative exploratory studies, our findings reflect the views of our 20 participants and are not generalisable to a wider population as a result. Exploring how applicable these findings are to the wider population of families and domestic workers is the subject of future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">FUTURE WORK</head><p>This research is part of a research study of bystander privacy concerns in smart homes in Jordan. future research will aim to verify our research findings, and to capitalize on them.</p><p>Areas of interest include: a) to study contextual dynamics (e.g., religious background, and social norms) and how to leverage them, and b) To study possible means of moderating autocratic tendencies within smart homes in light of the absence of privacy rights and policies in Jordan and similar contexts, c) To explore how designers can support mechanisms and practices which mitigate privacy risks for bystanders, and d) To investigate how policy makers can take into account workers in smart homes in future policy developments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION</head><p>This research aims to study the impact of smart devices on the privacy of smart home bystanders (domestic workers) in a non-western context (Jordan) to identify potential privacy improvements for this user group. The study identified various privacy concerns, practices, and scenarios in which bystanders are subject to monitoring and data collection in smart homes. The study further pointed to asymmetries of knowledge, control, and power dynamics between different user groups. The importance of user agency in the smart home, both for workers and the families employing them, was highlighted against a background of unclear privacy policies, rights and regulations, and in addition to strong social and religious norms and customs.</p><p>We found that some workers perceived themselves to be targeted for data collection, while others perceived themselves as being just bystanders to smart devices. The research findings showed weak public awareness of smart homes and only a basic understating of privacy among our participants. Workers were mostly concerned about video and audio data collection, without paying attention to other types of data smart devices might be collecting about them. In contrast to this, families were much more concerned by the presence of workers in the smart homes and its impact on their family's privacy.</p><p>In light of the absence of explicit privacy rights in Jordan, we found that some families have an autocratic view about what is allowable in their home, and that they are free to do whatever they wish inside their home with or without permission. Interestingly, others believe that they have an ethical or religious obligation to inform workers about smart devices. Most workers prefer that families inform them about the existence, functions, locations, and the purposes of the installed smart devices. Some workers mentioned that the lack of disclosure of the smart devices is a clear sign of disrespect of workers' rights and of workers on the personal level. Many workers expressed that they do not feel able to assert their privacy preferences, or to protect their privacy with the installed smart devices, and they had to accept this to avoid conflicts with their employers and to maintain their job.</p><p>We found also that social and religious norms in Jordan influenced positive privacy practices and also influenced perceptions of privacy concerns and rights. We identified a level of mistrust from families towards workers, where families perceive workers as strangers in their homes, which is driving some families to use smart devices to monitor workers in order to ensure the security and safety of the home. finally, our participants had a number of aspirations for innovative privacy controls which they believed would be better suited to their needs.</p><p>As a result of our findings, we made a number of recommendations to help inform and improve public awareness efforts; to point out areas for policymakers to address in future privacy rights, laws and policies; and to motivate smart device designers to consider non-western user aspirations for better privacy control features.</p><p>Appendix-B </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Research Process and Methodology</figDesc><graphic url="image-1.png" coords="5,120.63,107.60,368.50,113.39" type="bitmap" /></figure>
