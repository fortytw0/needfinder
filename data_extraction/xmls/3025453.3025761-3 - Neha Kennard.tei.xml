<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Though prior work shows parents worry about screen media experiences displacing physical activity and time outdoors, this research does not account for location-based mobile games like Pokémon GO, which specifically facilitate outdoor activity. To fill this gap in the research, we surveyed and interviewed parents to understand (1) their values and perceptions of this type of gameplay and (2) how they co-play Pokémon GO with their children. Our findings provide empirical evidence that, in addition to appreciating the increased exercise and time outdoors, parents valued how play led to family bonding experiences. Furthermore, some traditional concerns about screen time persisted in this context, and new concerns about safety in real-world environments emerged. Parents mitigated these concerns with rules and gameplay choices, such as maintaining control of the mobile device, to ensure children were safe. This work contributes an empirical understanding of families as co-users of technology and offers a generative lens to study and design for joint media engagement among family members where gameplay differs from normative notions of screen time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>As technology becomes ubiquitous in our lives, with an increasing number of adults, teens, and children owning and using mobile devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">60]</ref>, screen time has become a highly debated and elusive topic for families <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">66,</ref><ref type="bibr">71]</ref>. Overexposure to screens has been associated with hostility in children <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[65]</ref>; development of anxiety <ref type="bibr">[77]</ref> and attention disorders <ref type="bibr">[78]</ref>; risk of obesity, disordered sleep, and other health problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">59]</ref>; Internet addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and a myriad of other concerns. As such, the fear that children are displacing other "healthier," more "social," or more "educational" activities by engaging with screenbased media is seemingly omnipresent <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[67]</ref>. In response to these concerns and the fact that digital media is now everywhere, parents have had to take on new roles as mediators of their children's screen time <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">58</ref>].</p><p>Yet, with advances in digital technologies and new media comes the knowledge that not all screen time is created equal. Children passively and silently viewing television programming alone is "different" than them talking to grandparents over video chat, actively reading a digital book with a parent, or playing Dance Dance Revolution (a dancing game) with a sibling. One way to conceptualize this difference is through joint media engagement (JME). JME refers to the experiences of people using media together, which include viewing, playing, searching, reading, contributing, and creating with either digital or traditional media <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[68]</ref>. JME supports learning by providing context and resources for people to co-create meaningful connections among representations, interests, and experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[68]</ref>. Because of how co-engagement leads to social interactions and learning, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that families participate with new media together <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">58]</ref>. JME is not a static concept though, as the options for how families can co-engage with new media are rapidly evolving. On July 6, 2016, Niantic, Inc. released Pokémon GO, a location-based mobile game in which players use their device's GPS capabilities to navigate their avatar in the virtual world by physically moving through real world locations that are meaningful in the game. Then, players can locate, capture, battle, and train virtual characters in the game world called Pokémon ('Pocket monsters') <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[43]</ref>. The game also enables optional augmented reality features that use a mobile device's camera, such that Pokémon appear on the screen as if they were physically co-located in the surrounding area.</p><p>As Pokémon GO became popular so quickly, with over 500 million downloads in two months <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[41]</ref>, it seemed to attract parents and children alike to play together [29, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">51]</ref>. While other types of similar games exist both commercially (e.g., Ingress) and as research prototypes (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">62]</ref>), Pokémon GO is the first popularized mainstream locationbased mobile game that is available for families to play together. Moreover, unlike Ingress, which requires its players to be 13 years or older, Pokémon GO has explicit provisions for children under 13 to play with parental consent <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[44]</ref>, which are in compliance with laws like the United States' Children's Online Privacy Protection Act <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>. Consequently, the emergence of Pokémon GO provided an ideal platform to study how parents are mediating and jointly engaging with their children with a location-based mobile game-a type of screen-based media that, in some ways, flips the normative paradigm of screen time by encouraging more physically grounded experiences that screen time is often perceived to displace. While its usage has declined since the game debuted, the main concern of this paper is not Pokémon GO itself per say. Rather, it is about families' experiences with and views of this kind of gameplay from the perspective of parents. Specifically, in this work, we were interested in understanding parents' experiences, perspectives, and attitudes regarding their children playing location-based mobile games, in particular, Pokémon GO. We wanted to learn more about the choices parents and families make on how to play the game, any rules they set about their children's game use and why, how they might jointly engage in this type of gaming with their children, and other relevant experiences. To answer these questions, we administered a qualitative survey to 67 parents (the majority from the U.S.) and conducted interviews with 20 parents in Seattle, Washington, USA from late-July to mid-August 2016. We approached and interviewed all 20 interview participants in a public space where they were already playing or watching their children play Pokémon GO.</p><p>We found that, in addition to exercise and time outdoors, parents valued how play led to family bonding experiences. This play fit into their lives, coinciding with other important activities (i.e., family walks, dog walks) or as specifically planned Pokémon GO time. Additionally, while some traditional concerns about screen time persisted for parents, new concerns about safety in real-world environments emerged. Parents made rules and gameplay choices centered around these concerns that have not be previously reported in literature, which ensured their children were safe. For example, parents reported always accompanying their children while playing and staying in control of the mobile device during gameplay to make sure children were not harmed in the physical environment. These findings both support and bring new light to research on joint family participation and learning with new media.</p><p>With this work, we make two main contributions to the HCI community. The first is a new empirical understanding of families as technology users, their values, and perspectives. This understanding can help us reflect on how we may or may not be designing appropriately for this user group.</p><p>Second, we contextualize families' experiences with Pokémon GO within the conditions and processes that Takeuchi and Stevens <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[68]</ref> identify as leading to productive JME. We validate how these conditions have been brought to life by the implementation of Pokémon GO, and therefore (as predicted) fostered JME for families. We also bring up new conditions that fostered JME in this distinctive context of playing Pokémon GO. Thus, through our discussion, we contribute a generative understanding that promotes studying and designing for JME among family members, where gameplay differs from normative notions of screen time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RELATED WORK</head><p>There has been a significant, growing body of research in family technology and media use within the HCI community <ref type="bibr">[24]</ref>. This work has examined the role of technology in family life and how technology supports family interaction and learning through co-use in different ways (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">19,</ref><ref type="bibr">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">27,</ref><ref type="bibr">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">36,</ref><ref type="bibr">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">70]</ref>). We build on this work to expand our notions of HCI in the family context. In the interest of space, in this section we primarily focus on theory and literature in parental mediation and forms of family co-use in relation to games specifically.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parental Mediation of Children's Digital Media Use</head><p>Throughout their long-term collaborative ethnographic study of the everyday digital media practices of children and teens in the United States, Ito et al. <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref> found that parents consistently worried about the amount of time their children spent using new media. They were concerned with how their children were spending time online, on their mobile phones, playing video games, using their iPods, and talking to their friends over instant messenger, on social networking sites, and their mobile devices. As shown in other studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">76]</ref>), these types of concerns are common among parents. According to parental mediation theory, there are three main ways that parents counteract their concerns about screen time. They mediate their children's digital media use through restrictive mediation, active mediation, and social co-viewing or couse <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">72]</ref>.</p><p>Parents who make rules, control, and place limits on children's media use, mainly to counteract negative effects, are engaging in restrictive mediation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">72]</ref>. Contrasting parents who allow their children to use devices freely without any limits (i.e., digital enablers), parents who engage in restrictive mediation to avoid negative side effects of technology use are a known as digital limiters <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">55]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr">Ito et al.'s [25]</ref> study, parents placed restrictions on new media use, such as setting time limits and requiring children to finish schoolwork, chores, and "productive activities" before playing digital games or going on social networks. They also set up specific media areas in the house to be able to monitor their children's digital media use in a more public space <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>. These types of rule setting emerge in many other studies on parental restrictions of children's screen time as well (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">47]</ref>).</p><p>As a protective measure, parents also enter dialogues with their children to explain and discuss aspects of new media and its usage, with purposes that are both instructive (e.g., to teach about content in child-friendly language) and evaluative (e.g., to express disapproval). This type of mediation is referred to as active mediation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">72]</ref>. Active mediation occurs particularly in families with older children <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[61]</ref> or when parents have positive perceptions about Internet use for younger children <ref type="bibr">[46]</ref>.</p><p>The last type of mediation within parental mediation theory is social co-viewing or co-use <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">72]</ref>, which has both educational and entertainment purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[48]</ref>. Often, parents who mediate their children's screen time by engaging in it with them are scaffolding the experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[68]</ref>. Following <ref type="bibr">Vygotsky [74]</ref>, they guide or help in areas where their children need support, ultimately enhancing what is good about the experience and allowing their children to learn and grow. In these moments, parents teach, collaborate with, consult on non-technical issues, provide resources to, and even learn from their children <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, which all positively impact children's learning. A middle ground between digital enablers and digital limiters, parents who both actively mediate and co-use digital media with their children are known as digital mentors <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">55]</ref>.</p><p>One survey of 4,000 families in the U.S. <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref> found that 59% of parents of "gamer children" played computer and video games with them weekly. However, parents also imposed time limits on this usage more than on any other form of entertainment <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>. In another study of 3,000 U.S. parents [37], researchers found 92% of parents whose children play video games play with them; and 77% of those parents said it was to spend time together. Still, most parents preferred that children played on game consoles, not computers or mobile devices, because they are easier to monitor.</p><p>In the following two sections, we further discuss two forms of co-use (that allow for active, instructive mediation in situ), specifically focusing on gaming together: hanging out and joint media engagement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Families 'Hanging Out' with Games</head><p>One way that co-use has been conceptualized is as a genre of participation with new media called 'hanging out' <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Ito et al. [25]</ref> define 'hanging out' as when people engage with new media in the process of spending time together. This is a social experience, and so the digital media itself is not necessarily the central focus. In Ito et al.'s [25] studies, families 'hung' out with new media and viewed this time as a way to facilitate both communication and bonding. This was even true for families who "idealized unplugging," yet still watched television and movies together. In some families, the main way that parents and children connected (especially fathers and sons) was through joint gaming. For others, gaming was still a consistent yet fluid way to spend time together as a family. Therefore, overall, gaming was a particularly important aspect for families 'hanging out' together. <ref type="bibr">Ito et al. [25]</ref> note specifically, "'Hanging out' genres of gaming enable people to bridge different forms of gaming expertise and to cross generational and gender divides" (p. 207). This finding about gaming as a bridge holds across various other studies as well. For instance, Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[32]</ref> found that their gamer interviewees often fondly remembered playing games with family members from as early as four to five years old; thus, gaming was an important part of their childhood. Similarly, in their qualitative study of console gaming, Voida and Greenberg <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[73]</ref> found that these types of games serve as a "computational meeting place," bringing together individuals in families to foster social interactions. Following this research, we wanted to understand if, how, and why this type of 'hanging out' might occur around Pokémon GO.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Joint Media Engagement (JME) &amp; Gaming in Families</head><p>Another type of parental co-use, which encompasses 'hanging out,' is JME. As mentioned in the Introduction, JME refers to the experiences of people using media together. JME is considered important because of how this engagement supports learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[68]</ref>. Through JME, participants can make sense and meaning together in a particular situation and for future situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[63]</ref>. However, JME is not limited to solely "educational" media; rather, it concerns studying "all forms of media, especially those that dominate young people's time and experience" <ref type="bibr">[68, p. 5]</ref>. Regarding gaming, Stevens et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[64]</ref> claim that collaboration during and around video gameplay provides a positive learning environment; this is because "in-room" (i.e., literally in a room, around gameplay) interactions are social and empowering as players share knowledge and see it successfully used by others. Moreover, boundaries between "in-game," "inroom," and "in-world" (i.e., everyday life) interactions are blurred, facilitating the transfer of knowledge between them <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[64]</ref>. Particularly, "in-room" interactions have complex bidirectional continuities with players' everyday lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[64]</ref>.</p><p>There are a small but growing number of HCI researchers who have studied JME, specifically joint gaming and digital play, within families that include children. While not exhaustive, we discuss some of these studies below. First, researchers have found that parents and children need explicit roles to productively engage with media together. In Brooks et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> case study with Electric Racer, a computer game specifically designed for two-player intergenerational play, parents and children needed roles within the game clarified, so that parents knew the game's educational goals and how they were supposed to scaffold their children's learning. Second, technology design can also foster JME among siblings (i.e., family members that represent a different co-user group than friends and parents). Ballagas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> found that their mobile augmented reality and cooperative problem solving game (Electric Agents) facilitat-ed physical coordination, physical support, and verbal instructions, clarifications, and communication between older-younger sibling pairs. Third, JME does not require even expertise between co-participants. In Aarsand's <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> ethnographic study, uneven expertise between children and parents about video games fostered joint gaming. When children have more expertise and adults are novices, it allows children to take the lead and disrupt the typical balance of power between children and adults. This can be motivating for sustained joint engagement. Fourth, JME can happen over distances and foster a sense of togetherness. Through a lab study, Follmer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref> found that, for children under seven and their remote family members, playing over video creates a sense of "togetherness" by physically doing something together, as opposed to just talking; that physical objects in play scaffold physical interactions, which lead to discussions; and that story-based content leads to communication and helps scaffold parental guidance. Finally, exergames have been found to be productive for JME. <ref type="bibr">Saksono et al. [53]</ref> designed and evaluated Spaceship Launch, a task-mastery exergame for parents and children. They found parents viewed in-game competition between players as motivating, which spurred social interactions. Their findings also highlighted the importance of designing systems to help children and parents increase both of their physical activity together.</p><p>Moving forward, Takeuchi and Stevens <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[68]</ref> note an important area for future research is studying "the qualities of media design and deliberate use that encourage productive JME" (p. 55). Since JME is not a static issue, it will need to be consistently reassessed as new technology changes and develops over time. Here, we examine the values, practices, interactions, and relationships that occur and develop around the deliberate use of a type of game not currently covered in the family JME literature (Pokémon GO) from the point of view of parents. By understanding these perspectives of and experiences with a game that have already pervaded families' lives, which we relate back to the game's design, we follow Takeuchi and Stevens' <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[68]</ref> call for research; ultimately, we help build knowledge about what design can do to foster productive JME.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p>For this study, we targeted surveying and interviewing adult guardians who allowed their children to play location-based mobile games. Initially, our research team conducted nonparticipant observations of families playing Pokémon GO with children in public locations, such as parks, shopping centers, Pokémon events, and a university campus. Our team discussed insights from these observations, which informed our qualitative survey and interview questions. We both piloted and iterated on these protocols before deploying them. We recruited for the survey on online social media platforms such as Facebook, Craigslist, and community mailing lists, which enabled participation from a wider range of people. Even though we encouraged participation from families who played other location-based mobile games with children, every survey respondent reported on playing Pokémon GO. Respondents completed the survey in approximately 45 minutes. They were then entered into a US$50 Amazon gift card drawing, which four people received. In parallel, we also conducted 10-minute in-person semi-structured interviews with parents in a local public park, where many people played Pokémon GO. Interviewing parents in the context of family gameplay ensured that they could reflect on their gaming process insitu. We conducted interviews in the afternoon and evening, over two days: 2 weeks (n = 6) and 6 weeks (n = 14) since the release of the game. Parents received small toys for their children for participating in the interview.</p><p>The interview and survey included similar open-ended questions to ensure triangulation. Question topics included:</p><p>(1) perceived benefits of and concerns about the game, (2) their rules for their children playing the game, (3) how the above topics were similar to or different from other games their children played, and (4) descriptions of their most memorable and recent experiences playing the game. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. The study was approved by the University of Washington's Human Subjects Division.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>A total of 87 adult guardians (of children under age 18) participated in this research; 67 were survey participants (S1-S67) and 20 (P1-P20) were interviewees. All but one was a parent (one interviewee was an aunt); thus, we refer to our participants as "parents." Parents' ages ranged from 25 to 65 years old (M = 42; SD = 7.2); 70% identified as female, 28% as male, and 2% as androgynous/other. Parents' children's ages ranged from 2 to 17 years old (M = 9.6; SD = 3.9); 62% of these children were reported as male and 38% as female. Most families lived in the United States, with only two survey participants reporting living elsewhere (i.e., Netherlands and Canada). Of the survey participants, 30% held a master's degree, 25% a bachelor's degree, 24% a doctorate, 7% a professional degree, and 3% an associate's degree; 4% had vocational training, and 4% completed some college but did not hold a degree. These survey participants' household incomes ranged from less than $20,000 to over $200,000 per year with 74% them earning over $100,000 per year.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>We took a joint inductive-deductive approach to the analysis of our qualitative data <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>. Two authors first independently open coded all the survey data, following an inductive approach. They then met to group and iterate on the codes according to consistent themes. Next, the same two coders read through half of the interview transcripts each, and coded them following a similar process. However, for coding interviews, authors looked for similarities across themes in the survey and interview data (a deductive approach) while iterating on and adding new codes as they emerged. Finally, the coders wrote memos, from which they abstracted higher-level themes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINDINGS</head><p>In this section, we describe the main themes that emerged from our analysis, regarding parents' experiences, values, and perspectives about their children playing Pokémon GO and playing Pokémon GO together with their children.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterization of Family Play</head><p>The majority of our participants indicated that they played Pokémon GO with their children, as opposed to their children playing independently from them. Seventeen (85%) of our interview participants were at our interview site specifically to play the game together with their children. For our survey participants, 59 (88%) reported that they play Pokémon GO together, either with other family members, friends, or just them two. For the other eight participants (12%) who did not play with their children, five participant's children (age 10-17) played with their siblings and/or friends without an adult; and two participants' children (age 8 and 17) played with their other parent. Additionally, 37 survey participants (55%) specified that they play Pokémon GO by themselves or with other adults, without any children present.</p><p>The families in our study reported that joint Pokémon GO gameplay happened both spontaneously, such as on the way to other activities or errands, and as a planned activity. Regarding spontaneous play, parents reported that their children often played when the parents were driving, when they noticed there were Pokémon nearby, or in other situations to "kill time." Some examples reported by parents included seeing Pokémon nearby after having dinner at a restaurant, while waiting for another child to be dismissed from camp, or when having to walk from the car that was parked a half-mile from where they were going.</p><p>Yet, other parents talked about how playing Pokémon GO became a specific activity that the family planned to do together. In some cases, especially for our interview participants, families decided to go to certain locations because they had heard from their friends, co-workers, or the Internet about these locations being great spots to find Pokémon. At these spots, there were often many other people playing. Specifically, interviewees perceived the experience of seeing crowds (sometimes hundreds) of people out enjoying a similar activity as exciting. However, most survey participants also reported playing Pokémon GO in and around the neighborhood and at nearby parks with fewer crowds, which they specifically described as "safe." Furthermore, Pokémon GO led to entire extended family and friends playing together. For example, P15 (a 31-year-old mother) brought a group of ten family members (three adults, five children, and two infants) to the interview site to play the game, which is a new and extremely social form of media co-participation.</p><p>Parents also appreciated how the game became a motivation for both their children and them to go outside and exercise in ways that were convenient and fit into their lives. Here, we see a shift in screen time usage; families are purposely scheduling time together outside their homes to engage in the game. For instance, S26, a 43-year-old mother who played with her 7-year-old son, said, "There are times I cannot get out and walk the dogs as my husband works nights and my son just doesn't want to walk. But now I can incite [my son] with the game and he wants to go!!!" Another mother, S7, a 31-year-old with a three-year-old daughter and another one-year-old, mentioned that her family is walking more because of the game. She noted, "We go out for nightly long walks as a family… We stop when we see Pokémon and they help to catch them. They get really excited to go out for walks so I love taking them." For some participants, this led to walking thousands of more steps a day. A 41-year-old father (P13) said his 11year-old daughter "probably lost twelve pounds since she's been playing [the game]." A popular term participants used for such walks was "Poké-walks," which became dedicated family experiences that parents predictably appreciated for how they were motivation for exercising and going outside.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Turn-Taking &amp; Gameplay Roles</head><p>Parents consistently reported on their gameplay practices that involved taking turns and having particular roles during gameplay. In most instances, the family shared one phone to play the game. Some families took turns in specific time intervals; some planned based on gameplay, such as each member catching a specific number of Pokémon, and some let children take turns on one device in ways that were age appropriate and/or matched the child's abilities and interests. For S34, a 35-year-old mother who played with her 2-year-old daughter, this meant that they took turns on the phone because her daughter is learning to share. S34 holds and stays in control of the phone, but "tell[s] her <ref type="bibr">[daughter]</ref> what she needs to do and let <ref type="bibr">[s]</ref> her do things that are age appropriate, ie <ref type="bibr">[sic]</ref>, she can spin, but she's not evolving or transferring Pokémon." Other parents set time limits on turns. A 42-year-old mother, S55, and her 6year-old son each got about five minutes with the phone, passing it back and forth. S6, a 46-year-old mother who plays with her 7-year-old son, said that they set a timer for five minutes each to ensure equal turn-taking. In addition to being a mechanism for imposing rules, some parents were also constrained to a single device due to low memory or compatibility issues, or not wanting to spend money on additional data plans and devices. An interesting workaround to this was tethering a data-enabled device's hotspot with a child's Wi-Fi-only device (which had the added benefit of also keeping them close by).</p><p>Nevertheless, other parents reported that each person in the family had their own individual device when playing in the same space. Although parents and children were on separate devices, they were still playing together because of how they ran to catch Pokémon at the same time, took over Gyms together (a competitive aspect of gameplay, where players battle for ownership of a particular public location), or generally talked about the game. In some cases, having multiple phones still led to sharing the devices. For example, S18, a 50-year-old mother of two sons (the main player being the 12-year-old son), described how she, her sons, and two of their friends played the game in the car while her husband drove them to the pool. She recounted, "We had 3 phones to play on so we took turns giving each other time to play… We just passed the phones around."</p><p>Parents also spoke about the ways in which they took on separate roles during gameplay, which often integrated into how they took (or did not take) turns. These roles included parents taking safety roles, such as holding the phone while walking or navigating and suggesting routes. Often, roles were also divided based on skill level or difficulty of the gameplay. A 37-year-old mother (S35) said her 7-year-old daughter played mostly, "but sometimes she gave [her] the phone for [catching] harder Pokémon." Comparably, a 37year-old mother who plays with her 7-year-old son on her device (S33) described how they decided where to go together but took turns catching Pokémon; she usually caught those, and "if he didn't capture <ref type="bibr">[one]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>in 3 tries, he'd give up control to [his mom]."</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Family Bonding</head><p>Another theme that emerged from our data was parents feeling that Pokémon GO time with their children led to family bonding. Playing together or watching their children play the game was perceived as quality time between parents and children. Parents reported that it even led to them spending more time together and talking more than usual (both about and/or not about the game). For instance, P4, a 45-year-old father who plays Pokémon GO with his 42-year-old wife, 15-year-old daughter, and 9-year-old son, stated, "I think it reinforces that we have common interests and helps us to have a good dialogue as we're sharing this experience." Father P13 said that due to the game, he and his daughter "honestly talk a lot more." Parents recounted how they talk about the game itself, beyond playing the game. Additionally, parents spoke about how they enjoyed playing separately from their children and then showing their children what they had accomplished. P16, a 38-yearold mother of two boys (age 7 and 4) whose older son plays Pokémon GO, said she sometimes plays for her son and moves him up to the next level; then her son says, "Yay mom! You're the coolest mom ever!" Similarly, S35 recounted, "I love that this is a game we can play together as a family, and I often play a little during the day (alone) so we can talk about my progress at night. My daughter's enthusiasm is turning me into a gamer!" Being able to play together has encouraged her to play separately so they can talk about it together more. P14, a 31-year-old father who plays with his 7-year-old daughter, discussed how they talk about the game, feel a sense of camaraderie, and have been brought closer by the experience. He recounted a time when they ran together to find a Pokémon: "Yeah, we were both running together, and she was looking at me, and she was smiling. It was just a great experience. It turned out it was a Cubone [a type of Pokémon]. I think that was her first Cubone, so that was cool. But it wasn't really about the Pokémon." This example shows how, in relation to family bonding, the experience does not necessarily have to do with the game itself but with what the game facilitates and fosters for family interactions and relationships.</p><p>As some parents played the game on their own without their children (55% of survey participants) or had played older versions of Pokémon when they were growing up, playing the game together offered a chance for parents to show their expertise to their children and share a similar "growing-up" experience. P12, a 25-year-old father who plays with his 3year-old son and 5-year-old daughter, indicated he was the most interested in the game out of everyone in the family. When asked about what he learned from playing the game, he said, "That you can share a game [among all ages]…I grew up on this game. For them to also grow up on it, it's like there's that bond, and I learned that my kids can love something as much as I can. We can both be kids together."</p><p>Yet, in many instances, there was a shift in expertise: children were the experts in the game and parents were open to learning. Children taught their parents about it and/or parents made efforts to learn about the game, reportedly facilitating bonding. P2, a mother of a 10-yearold boy, relayed how her son has taught her "a lot about the game," which was different from when she "didn't care" about engaging with or learning from her son while he was playing Pokémon on his Nintendo DS. Along the same lines, P10, a mother who just began playing with her 10year-old son, said, "I'm just amazed at how much I learned about this game so I could understand what he's talking about." In both examples, parents were making efforts to learn about a game in which their children were interested to facilitate playing and talking about the game together. Some parents also explicitly mentioned that they thought this type of bonding would not have occurred without the game. S25, a 43-year-old parent who goes out every night with their 16-year-old daughter to play Pokémon GO as "basically her chauffeur and bodyguard," said that the game allows them to spend quality time together, and "as an older teen that's not always something that happens." P11, a 27-year-old mother, indicated that the game gave she and her 7-year-old son "common ground to interact". A 41year-old mother (P9) who plays with her 8-year-old son, explained: "I think it's just helping us find a common thing we can do together as a mom and a boy, and that's really awesome for me. I'm excited about that. I like that he wants to share with me and talk to me about it. As a boy coming home from school, they don't tell you what they ate, or they don't tell you what their teacher said, but now he's telling me this stuff so it's a good way to be communicating. I think hopefully it will keep transcending into him wanting to about more things." Playing the game together has caused them to talk more, especially (as she out) as a mother and son. fathers expressed the same sentiment about their daughters. Both fathers P13 and P14 noted they were talking more with their since playing Pokémon GO.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>&amp; Workarounds</head><p>Unsurprisingly, almost of our participants had safety for their children in regard to gameplay. These centered around their children being potentially harmed by strangers or getting physically hurt, such as hit by a car, to not paying attention to where were going. Pointedly, S45, a 39-year-old mother of a son, commented, don't want my kids to be the dumb dumbs who fall off a cliff or <ref type="bibr">[get]</ref> run over by a because they [are] too engaged." As the most extreme about strangers, P19, father in his 50's with a son, said he and his wife were worried about the crowds and "crazy people." He said, can also kill people here. Somebody with a gun comes, can easily do a lot of damage… We don't feel safe right now." many of the rules parents had for gameplay related to these concerns. All the parents, including few that had older children (i.e., mid-to lateteens), required that they or another adult be with their while playing. Many explicitly reported that their children were not allowed to speak or play with strangers. For older children who were allowed to play on their own, parents requested that their children always be available by phone and only travel a certain distance from their home. Some also had rules that their older children were not to play at night, unless they were with an adult.</p><p>The ways that parents and younger children played together associated with these concerns as well. First, many of the children only played on their parent's personal device, that the child could not without their parent. Most pertinently, parents consistently reported on how they in control of the phone while walking; parents would either hold the phone or it would stay in their pocket until it (indicating that a Pokémon was nearby), and then would hand the phone to their child. Some families turns looking at the phone, so that one person was always looking at the street while they played. These ensured that children (and parents) would not be endangered by not looking at their surroundings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Screen Time</head><p>Other concerns of parents related to the concept of screen time. Participants referred to "screen time" broadly spoke to the idea of balance, using rhetoric like and "obsession." For instance, regarding former, P1 (a 38-year-old mother whose nine-year-old daughter plays) her main concern about the game was the screen" "it's still screen time." She noted, "I don't know to… stop it. It's a constant." Similarly, P16 said that game is just adding to "kids just always wanting to have time." Similar to other research (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>), some parents also noted how it was difficult to get back their devices from their children when they were playing Pokémon GO, which sometimes led to conflicts. To counteract these concerns, a few parents had rules (which extended to other forms of screen time) about gameplay.</p><p>included setting time limits, shutting down the device if children did not give it back, and parents staying in control of the phone. Many also required that their children had to attend to their other responsibilities commitments before playing the game. These included homework, reading, drawing, driver's education training, sports, and other similar activities. Some parents mentioned that they begin to implement or intensify rules once the academic school year However, some of these same parents and others that this type of screen time with the game was than other types of screen time, which changed their rules and perceptions of gameplay. Participants reported this was due to perceived net benefits of getting spending time outdoors, learning about neighborhood, spending time with family and friends, and offline. For example, said they break their general solo screen time limit for GO because it is family activity. A 36-year-old stepmother a 9-year-old boy (S66) mentioned, "[E]ven if it's screen time, it's better than when he's playing because they are walking around and spending time together. Likewise, a of a 5-year-old boy and 4-year-old girl whose son plays (P8) was "less stringent on" screen time limits because of how the activity was outdoors and physically He said, "I like that. It's less screen time. They're just buried in [the screen] the whole time."</p><p>continually Pokémon GO gameplay as distinct from other forms of screen time, like sitting and video and computer games.</p><p>Many participants also reported about how playing allowed and their children to learn more about the and surrounding areas. This included learning about to navigate streets and specific structures, landmarks, locations, and art in the that they did not know about before. A 39year-old mother of a 12-year-old son (S45) noted, "There was a giant anchor memorial hidden behind trees that never have seen if it weren't for it also being a an important location in the game]." a 51-year-old mother of a 17-year-old son, said, I like about [the game] is that it points out some of the little (signs or artwork) that I might normally miss. Like at nearby lake] the benches that are PokéStops are marked with memorials. Most people overlook those it's of cool to stop and read them."</p><p>Finally, parents noted how the game enabled their children to be social with other people outside of the family, including connecting with new friends and even strangers. While most parents had rules that their children were not allowed to play with or talk to strangers, some noted how game allowed them to see friendly other players, they do not know, are. For S25 (age 43) said and her 16-year-old daughter learned how "in general other [Pokémon GO] players are quite nice and friendly."</p><p>explained they were playing one night and her old son worked with other players who they did not know on an externally collaborative aspect of the game: were a team. It was really nice, you know, to open up those of communication."</p><p>Connecting with new friends outside of the family particularly important for several participants. This was true P8's son who was homeschooled and for whom the enabled him to play and talk with other children; for P13's daughter who has autism spectrum disorder and for the game gave her "something in common to talk to the kids [at camp] about"; and for S26's son who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sensory issues, and autism and for whom the "game gives him the opportunity to fit in with kids and talk about it." because of how playing was a family, social, outdoor, and/or exercise activity, parents changed their rules and had about screen time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Our findings give us insight into the perspectives, values, experiences of parents they relate to screen time, JME, and 'hanging out' while playing Pokémon GO. For our parent participants, some traditional concerns about time held, namely digital media addiction and obsession. most parents did not seem to be about of social, physical, and outdoor activities (i.e., normally common concerns for parents regarding time) of how Pokémon GO and motivates these types of experiences. Additionally, the game sparked learning about the neighborhood because of how it caused them to go to locations that they would have otherwise. this reason, parents valued this gameplay as different from notions of screen time.</p><p>new concerns also emerged for that on safety, namely about their children getting harmed strangers or physically hurt, like walking into the street and getting hit by a car, because of how this type of game can lead players to not attention to their surroundings as they travel through While not paying attention due to focusing on a screen is a common concern for mobile devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[38]</ref>, it is more focus here because of how the game might encourage players to pay attention to digital map as they walk.</p><p>These types of concerns led to parental mediation practices that are particular to location-based mobile gaming.</p><p>Livingstone and Helsper <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[34]</ref> refer to differences between personal computer use compared to game console use; our results complement their notion of how changing technology is making restrictions and casual monitoring more difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[68]</ref>. Specifically, parents their children by engaging in restrictive mediation setting rules for how far older children allowed to travel), active mediation (e.g., having about where to travel to next), and co-use (e.g., playing together such that a parent takes on the role of keeping the phone in his or her pocket). contrasts parents' past preferences for wanting their to play on consoles <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref> and in shared media spaces in the home <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>. Thus, these mediation practices beyond typical rule setting, discussions, and cofor screen time because of how normally considered "in-room" activities completely overlap with "in-world" activities. Because it is a location-based mobile game, mediation was mainly about physicality (e.g., space, the body, in-person strangers, etc.).</p><p>ways in which families took turns, and/or had specific roles during gameplay supports research in as a form of parental mediation that facilitates learning well. Parents and children playing the game together taking turns and sharing (and even using timers to scaffold this experience) has the potential to help children learn these in situ. The fact that parents completed more difficult or less developmentally appropriate aspects of the game for their children, by either stepping in when or taking on specific gameplay roles, is a form of scaffolding for their children to learn how to play the game too. Also, the fact that parents reported that and their children discovered things about their and nearby locations while traversing these areas supports that mobile games are in ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">69]</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, one child or one parent having expertise or interest in the game served as motivation to together and as a form of bonding for families. This occurrence is specific to Pokémon GO of how the has existed since 1995, and the children of 1995 grown up to become parents themselves. This notion disparate child/parent and interest as play findings that one-sided expertise in a game is motivation keep playing together <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>our results follow research about joint participation gameplay as a form of 'hanging out' around new media that leads to family bonding <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>. Contrasting "in-room" activities, Pokémon GO fit into families' lives outside of the and incentivized "in-world" experiences, which it a new valuable way to be together. Thus, playing Pokémon GO immediate and extended) family time our participants. Parents appreciated how they learned, talked, and spent time together playing the game.</p><p>was particularly important to some of our participants who were parents of older teens, mothers of sons, and fathers of daughters. Our provides incentive to further study why location-based mobile might be avenues through and around which these different groups can bond. Perhaps this type of bonding and communication among the family can extend long-term other contexts or in this gaming context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Features Encourage JME</head><p>Using our findings, can reflect on the conditions and processes surrounding GO a location-based mobile game) that make it productive for family and out.' First, use our findings and Pokémon GO design features briefly show how the game facilitates the six conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[68]</ref> that lead to productive The game has simple that involve only a few different activities. parents and children in this gameplay in ways that made sense for their family. Additionally, the game does not require players to constantly look at the screen. Rather, parents could put the phone in their pocket as they walked until it was necessary for gameplay.</p><p>Additionally, based on this research, we claim that there are qualities about Pokémon GO that make it particularly encouraging for productive family JME and 'hanging out.' The first is that, location-based mobile game, it hinges on players going outside, walking, and in teams. Therefore, the reconciles some of the issues parents have with screen time and fits into the lives of families, including in their schedules, within various contexts, and during valued activities, while also not tying to the living room. Because of this, parents be more likely to accept or promote gameplay jointly participate with their children. this type of gameplay depends highly on dynamic outdoor context. our participants, this to new forms of learning (i.e., about the neighborhood) that further blurs between "in-room" and "in-game" knowledge transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">69]</ref>. Providing opportunities for families to learn in new ways is appealing and may lead to more productive JME.</p><p>GO facilitated families and children and being social other people outside of the family, in very large numbers. Because the requires going outside and moving, there is some to interact with people that are not co-engaging in one instance of gameplay. This added value of diverse, extremely social learning does not occur during games that bound to a specific place (besides perhaps in remote games). However, as shown in our findings, this value also into conflict parental concerns about strangers. tension highlights the of mediation of screen time in this context families to gain added benefits while mitigating potential dangers. while, based on findings of Brooks et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, Takeuchi and Stevens list "differentiation of roles" a JME design principle to how this can ensure all are challenged and/or entertained) and also claim, "less structure may to elicit dialogic inquiry" (p. 46), no parents reported Pokémon GO as frustrating or causing conflict due to a lack of in-game mechanisms for Rather, GO was not designed explicitly for co-use on a single device, but it is still being used as such. Perhaps because gameplay can be shared differently depending on how parents want to participate, it is motivation for JME. Some parents wanted to consistently play the game with (and without) their others wanted to watch their children and be their cheerleaders; and some wanted to help when their assistance was necessary. The fact that the roles were prescriptive allowed different types of families together.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Designing Location-Based Mobile Games for Families</head><p>we want to reflect on what our findings mean researchers other who want to design location-based mobile games for families. might these be disrupting? might they be enhancing?</p><p>terms of disruptions, we first point to the concerns that had about these types of games. is important to be that these types of games, particularly those that are reality games, still cause some worry for parents dangers that come along with traveling while looking at a phone. new hardware like the GO Plus [42], the Watch Google Glass, or HoloLens, which help players to keep watch of where they going and still pay attention to the game, could improve while navigating. also may be privacy concerns, which Pokémon GO not elicit, but could be for other location-based mobile games. Depending on the game mechanics, reflecting on issues of tracking and data sharing are especially relevant in this design context. Lastly, it is possible for these types of games to be inaccessible to those who cannot travel outside or in certain and exclusionary who live in rural areas who cannot afford large data plans.</p><p>In terms of enhancements, it seems that, to parents, true unique value of location-based mobile games over other games was being outside and physically active that this could be done all together. Some parents even specifically mentioned that they want to see more of these kinds of games produced. There are more opportunities to explore the integration of other types of could enhance terms of family participation and learning as well. Similar yet non-digital versions of these types of games, geocaching and scavenger hunts, and the research on their effects could help designers understand what new types of features could be integrated to enhance locationmobile gameplay for families. it seems that families in jointly participating in new media use together socially, outside, and while exercising poses an new research and design direction that appears to new media concerns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations &amp; Future Work</head><p>In this study, we did not discuss the perspectives or values parents who do not allow their children to play Pokémon GO. Without these perspectives, we cannot make claims about how to potentially engage families in joint gaming are not doing so already. work entails unpackthese parents' values and opinions. also did not survey or interview children about what they value in this con-It is important for future work to consider co-players' opinions and personal experiences, as perspectives and values affect how we understand and location-based mobile games for families.</p><p>our data is highly skewed toward mother participants and sons, future research needs to toward collecting greater responses from fathers and parents with then, we can if and, if so, how findings shift according to gender. Along these same lines, participants also have higher than average income and edulevels, which may affect our results' transferability. work needs to examine how socio-economic status and other relevant demographic factors influence parents regarding location-based mobile gaming their children.</p><p>we only studied this phenomenon in the immediately after Pokémon GO was released. The screen time rules that some of participants for their children correspond to prior work that routines (like structuring time in order to play games) change seawith summers and breaks being less structured It will be interesting to see families' rules and the characteristics of gameplay change during the school year, as the excitement type of novelty bias) Pokémon GO wanes. studying how and why the usage may have declined for families is important for future research, as it can potentially validate if our findings hold over time may lead to understandings of what can increase the and benefits of these technologies for families.</p><p>Finally, future ethnographic observations of families playlocation-based mobile games will triangulate this research, and support (or invalidate) parents' reports of their gameplay practices. New insights could also be gained by seeing how families potentially use the GO Plus and the Apple Watch to increase safety while playing.</p><p>For this research, we surveyed and interviewed 87 parents allow their children age 18) to play Pokémon GO, a new widely available and popular location-based game. By unpacking parents' and perceptions of this type of gameplay, we better understand families as users in a context where common percepof screen time appear to be flipped. While still had some typical concerns about time, the fact that the game motivates outdoor, social, and bonding activities helped mitigate these worries. Parents could alleviate new concerns safety accompanying and playing their children. Because type of gameplay fit into the of families, "in-room" and "in-world" expelessened typical screen time worries, allowed for and mixed control, and supported family bonding, this location-based mobile game created a productive platform for JME. Perhaps it was Pokémon that initially on-boarded families to play, but the valuable experiences of and interactions within families existed and continued to beyond the actual content of the Without these other important elements, we argue the popularity for families would not been sustained. Through our of these notions fitting our research into past in JME <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[68]</ref>, we provide a greater generative standing of types of contexts and processes JME. We hope this work will inspire new study and design for families' joint participation with new media where gameplay differs from normative notions of screen time.</p><p>Thank you to all our participants our helpful reviewers!</p></div>		</body>
