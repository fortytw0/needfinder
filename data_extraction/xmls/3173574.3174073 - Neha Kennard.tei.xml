<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>To successfully function within a team, students must develop a range of skills for communication, organization, and conflict resolution. For students on the autism spectrum, these skills mirror the social, communicative, and cognitive experiences that can often be challenging for these learners. Since instructors and students collaborate using a mix of technology, we investigated the technology needs of neurodiverse teams comprised of autistic and nonautistic students. We interviewed seven autistic students and five employees of disability services in higher education. Our analysis focused on technology stakeholder values, stages of small-group development, and Social Translucence -a model for online collaboration highlighting principles of visibility, awareness, and accountability. Despite motivation to succeed, neurodiverse students have difficulty expressing individual differences and addressing team conflict. To support future design of technology for neurodiverse teams, we propose: (1) a design space and design concepts including collaborative and affective computing tools, and (2) extending Social Translucence to account for student and group identities.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>In higher education, instructors increasingly emphasize teamwork as a learning objective <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[43]</ref>. Collaborative learning fosters better outcomes than individual learning and builds skills such as communication, organization, and confliction resolution. Employers expect graduates to have teamwork experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[7]</ref>, which is critical in a workforce that is shifting from individual production to team production <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[8]</ref>.</p><p>A student team brings together diverse students, including students with and without disabilities. Our research focuses on students on the autism spectrum 1 and their teamwork with neurotypical students. Many young autistic adults desire to attend higher education, yet face academic and social challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Individuals on the autism spectrum are impacted to varying levels in areas of verbal communication, non-verbal communication, social interactions, and cognitive styles <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. They may benefit from adapted ways of communicating, performing executive functioning tasks, and processing sensory stimuli <ref type="bibr">[41]</ref>. Autistic students who are transitioning from secondary to higher education tend to experience difficulty adjusting to new environments, navigating uncertainty in daily routines, and establishing new social connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">11]</ref>. Parental involvement, systemic, and mandatory support decrease as students move into adulthood and higher education. Although these changes enable autistic students to maintain privacy and autonomy, students often need to become more responsible for advocating for their needs. Some students prefer not to disclose their autism, and some students (regardless of their stance on disclosure) do not seek out services <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Facing social and academic challenges, often without adequate support, can be overwhelming for autistic students. These challenges are reflected in their low graduation rate: 39%, compared to 52% for the general population <ref type="bibr">[47]</ref>.</p><p>To support the diverse mix of students in a class, instructors employ a range of learning strategies, one of which is leveraging computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). CSCL incorporates technology to deliver content (e.g., computer aided instruction) and computer-mediated communication (CMC) such as video conferencing and online forums. These technologies should follow Universal Design <ref type="bibr">[40]</ref> to be accessible to individuals with and without disabilities. However, technology is traditionally designed for either mainstream students or students with disabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[45]</ref>. For autistic students, specialized technology includes assistive technology (e.g., augmentative communication devices) and applications that support executive functioning. Designing CSCL technology for both neurotypical and autistic students together can better support inclusion of neurodiverse students <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[45]</ref>.</p><p>The HCI theory of Social Translucence <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[13]</ref> provides us with a useful model for exploring how technology is used in structured social interactions, such as student teamwork. This theory posits that designers can create more effective online knowledge communities by transferring in-person social norms and cues to online interactions. The main principles of Socially Translucent systems are visibility of socially significant information, awareness of relevant social cues, and accountability of actions among group members. These principles are highly relevant to neurodiverse teams, however, young autistic adults often describe challenges adapting to social norms and expressing themselves verbally and non-verbally in social contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr">59]</ref>. Thus, our novel application of Social Translucence gave rise to an additional principle for the theory, identity.</p><p>In this work, we investigate current strategies of supporting neurodiverse teams in higher education and what design considerations can be made in future team-supporting technology. Specifically, our research questions were: RQ1: What are the current technology-and nontechnology-based strategies that support neurodiverse student teamwork in higher education? RQ2: What are important design considerations and capabilities of team-based technology that can support neurodiverse teams? In what ways can these technologies support social translucence during collaboration?</p><p>We interviewed seven autistic students and five employees of student disability services. Our analysis focused on stakeholder values across the stages of small-group development. Within the context of higher education, our contributions are:</p><p>1. Empirical evidence on socio-technical challenges and strategies of neurodiverse teams. 2. A design space and design implications for technologies to more holistically support the values of neurodiverse teams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Evolution of the Social Translucence theory to include</head><p>a new principle, identity, and to extend beyond online settings to in-person technology-mediated settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RELATED WORK</head><p>Our research is motivated by Universal Design for Learning and informed by research on technology-mediated solutions for neurodiverse students and team-based technologies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Universal Design for Learning</head><p>Many higher education institutions aim to provide personalized services to students with disabilities. They provide face-to-face counseling, peer mentoring, and support for obtaining accommodations. In partnership with instructors, these services promote the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) <ref type="bibr">[40]</ref> framework for supporting all students, including those with disabilities. Under UDL, educators proactively create an environment and curriculum that accommodates different styles of learning. They should provide multiple means to represent learning materials, to express knowledge, and to engage with students <ref type="bibr">[40]</ref>.</p><p>A UDL approach to teamwork would provide an adaptive learning environment, giving students multiple ways to engage with teams. This may be especially helpful for autistic students who may find group work particularly stressful <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[14]</ref>. In guidelines for inclusive teaching at the university level, Fabri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[15]</ref> recommend that instructors provide extra support for working in groups, including intervention when communication fails and giving explicit ground rules and roles to all members of the group. While designing a graduate course that adhered to the tenets of UDL, Rose et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[45]</ref> allowed for multiple means of participation in group discussions by offering both face-toface groups and entirely online discussion groups. We explore how existing and novel UDL approaches may better support neurodiverse teams that include autistic students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Technology-Mediated Strategies for Autistic Students</head><p>Recent technology-based efforts in UDL for autistic students focus on supporting adaptive learning techniques and building executive functioning skills (e.g., organization and planning). <ref type="bibr">Benton et al. [4]</ref> developed a participatory design approach for designing a math application with teams of autistic middle school students. This design approach scaffolded teamwork by having the children come up with a team name, rules, and roles for each of the children, and giving support and guidelines to help children brainstorm together and evaluate each other's ideas.</p><p>CMC helps autistic adults initiate social connections, especially on special-interest sites. Burke et. al <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[9]</ref> found that autistic adults appreciated CMC interactions in which they can communicate asynchronously with less pressure to respond to paralinguistic cues. However, over the course of using CMC, people had difficultly building online relationships due to issues such as trust and disclosure.</p><p>Researchers have explored technology-mediated social supports for autistic individuals, such as specialized social network sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[24]</ref> and gaming servers <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[44]</ref>. Given the desire of autistic adults for social connections and inclusion, our research focuses on understanding needs of autistic higher education students and how technology can help them navigate difficulties in social interactions, avoid misunderstandings, and foster team cohesion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Technology for Supporting Teamwork</head><p>In CHI and CSCW communities, design of technology for teamwork has primarily focused on workplace collaboration <ref type="bibr">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">52]</ref>, software development teams <ref type="bibr">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr">26,</ref><ref type="bibr">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">31]</ref>, learning to collaborate through gaming <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref>, and facilitating global diversity in virtual teams <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">51,</ref><ref type="bibr">56]</ref>. Systems have been designed and evaluated for collaborative sharing of mood, to promote emotional well-being in workplaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">46,</ref><ref type="bibr">50]</ref>. From this work, we drew inspiration for design concepts that may be applied to the educational setting, noting that people's goals and motivations differ between the two settings. The workplace setting tends to be competitive, output-driven, and employees are already expected to have specialized skills to perform and compete. The higher education environment is designed to support development of specialized interests, taking risks, and learning skills by pushing students outside comfort zones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THEORETICAL BACKGROUND</head><p>Our theoretical framing forefronts the social impacts on teamwork, technology-mediated collaboration, and identity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tuckman's Model for Small-Group Development</head><p>Tuckman's model for small-group development <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[54]</ref> describes team progression through four stages. In the first stage, forming, team members oriented to the task and begin to establish individual identities within the team. The storming stage, which may occur repeatedly, encompasses intragroup conflicts and confrontation. In the norming stage, the team formally or informally establishes group standards and expectations. The team finalizes the project plan and roles. During the performing stage, team members work together toward collective goals, and if successful, form a cohesive, stable team identity. Tuckman's model has been applied to group functioning in CSCL higher education <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref>, new communities <ref type="bibr">[42]</ref>, and even contestant communities on reality television <ref type="bibr">[29]</ref>. For our research, Tuckman's model helps attune us to team friction points that can be particularly challenging for neurodiverse teams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social Translucence in Socio-Technical Collaboration</head><p>Erickson and Kellogg proposed Social Translucence as a model for designing technology for online collaboration among large groups of knowledge workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[13]</ref>. They argued "designers can assume the existence of a consistent and unquestioned physics that underlies social interaction" <ref type="bibr">[13, p. 61]</ref>. Researchers have applied Social Translucence to domains such as social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[19]</ref>, Wikipedia <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[35]</ref>, and wireless sensing in an urban setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[30]</ref>. Applying Social Translucence to these domains has prompted capabilities that promote social awareness and resolve communication breakdowns <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. Some research applied Social Translucence to knowledge communities rooted in face-to-face relationships, such as collocated families who use systems <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref>. We build on this work to examine knowledge workers -students -in a hybrid online and inperson setting of higher education. Student teams operate within the constraints and freedoms of higher education. The student team is self-organizing, without the formal hierarchy of a workplace or family. We examine the ways that technology can support this dynamic environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identity in Human-Computer Interaction</head><p>During our research, a recurring theme emerged: identity. Within the broad psychological and sociological concepts of identity, our work surfaced issues around an individual's sense of self, disclosure to others of facets of one's identity, and group development of collective identity. Goffman <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[21]</ref> emphasized the social influence on identity, which develops as one negotiates social norms. Accordingly, HCI research has investigated the role of technology in an individual's sense of self and how they are perceived by others. For people with intersectional identities <ref type="bibr">[48]</ref>, such as veterans and transgender people, technology-mediated social connections can be especially beneficial for social inclusion and navigating life transitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">49]</ref>. We build upon this work to investigate the role of technology in identity formation for another intersectional group, autistic adult students. As young adults, autistic students are actively forming their identity at ego-centric, personal, and social levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[10]</ref>. Thus, they may be highly susceptible to external social influences, some of which is mediated by technology.</p><p>By probing into the social construction of identity, we seek to add social needs of autistic users to technological representations of identity. Primary examples are technology systems that deliver personalized user experiences based on user profiles. Researchers and practitioners have developed architecture platforms and applications that present customized user interfaces (e.g., a high contrast color scheme) and provide assistive technology (e.g., a screen reader) based on a user's profile and selected preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">57]</ref>. Some systems enable a user to explicitly state one's specific type of disability, and thus, access a set of pre-selected interface settings and assistive technology. Although some initiatives, notably the World Wide Web Consortium, include autistic users as target users, their technical guidelines are limited primarily to limiting sensory overload and providing simplified content <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[57]</ref>. We seek to inform the design of richer, more socially-aware personalization options for autistic users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p>We approached our research using the Value Sensitive Design (VSD) [17] framework, which forefronts the values of stakeholders of technology. During our empirical investigations, described in this section (and early in our research [58]), we strove to elicit the values and value tensions between the stakeholders of technology designed for neurodiverse student teams.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interviews with Staff of Student Disability Services</head><p>To gain an understanding of the support provided by universities, we conducted semi-structured interviews with five employees of student disability services at two local higher education institutions (henceforth labelled as E#).</p><p>All interviews (4 female; 1 male) were conducted in person, lasting no more than one hour. We inquired about the types of services they provide, common challenges of autistic students, and the strategies they teach the students.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interviews with Autistic Students in Higher Education</head><p>We interviewed seven autistic students (henceforth labelled as S#). We recruited students via email through higher education disability student services and autism therapy clinics. To protect participant anonymity, we report summarized demographics (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) and not the specific characteristics of each participant. Students were interviewed in-person (4) or online <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. Sessions lasted from 50-85 minutes (average=67 minutes). The sessions had three components: (1) a semi-structured interview, (2) a Q-methodology exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[38]</ref> to rank value statements, and</p><p>(3) a collage activity. The interview questions covered their autism diagnosis and resulting experiences related to education, plus their attitudes and experiences regarding higher education teamwork.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Developing and Probing Stakeholder Values</head><p>As we developed our conceptual understanding neurodiverse student teams, we identified the key stakeholders as autistic students, neurotypical teammates, instructors, disability services staff and support peers. We generated value statements (Appendix A) to capture the important attitudes and tensions of autistic students. These statements were based on literature and a preliminary analysis of our interviews with disability service employees <ref type="bibr">[58]</ref>. Four key values emerged: (1) individual comfort, ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) social comfort, (3) social connection, and (4) team cohesion (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). We used the Q-methodology exercise to probe autistic students about these values and to get insights on value tensions. The Q-methodology exercise requires the participant to place value statements in a pyramid shaped grid, from least important to most important (Appendix A, Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). This exercise provided an opportunity for participants to raise issues and experiences that were important to them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Developing Teamwork Design Space and Concepts</head><p>We developed a design space to contain concepts of teambased technology that currently exist, or may, in the future. This teamwork design space has two dimensions: team stages and stakeholder combinations. On the team stages dimension, we examined the tasks and challenges of Tuckman's team model. On the stakeholder combinations dimension (solo, peer pair, teams, and student-instructor pairs), we explore how values of the students can influence with whom they want to share personal and project information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design Method: Collage Activity</head><p>We used a collage activity to elicit participant needs and impressions of the design concepts. We explained the collage activity as a joint-brainstorming activity in which we used images and text phrases to highlight main points.</p><p>We presented abstract and photorealistic images representing key design concepts (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), common technology (e.g., a calendar), and common team activities (e.g., presenting on a whiteboard). We briefly explained unfamiliar concepts, such as group mood boards <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">46]</ref>.</p><p>To seed the brainstorming, we pinpointed a challenging team scenario that had emerged during the semi-structured interview. The participant and researchers co-created the collage with images, written notes, and hand drawings. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>The first author prepared a codebook based on team stages and emergent student values regarding teamwork, which are described above in "Developing and Probing Stakeholder Values." Using NVivo, the first and second authors then independently coded all interview transcripts. The research team iterated on code definitions and resolved discrepancies with coding. The final codebook (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>) consisted of Tuckman's team stages, the four student values, and codes based on challenges, strategies, and technology use.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FINDINGS</head><p>Similar themes emerged from the interviews with disability employees and students. We found that challenges and strategies were distinct in the stages of forming and storming, and overlapped during norming and performing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Uncertainty During Forming</head><p>Challenges for autistic students in the forming stage include selecting team members or being excluded, judging compatibility, deciding whether to disclose their diagnosis, distributing roles, and identifying team leaders. Even before teamwork begins, three students discussed experienced anxiety as they anticipated team projects. The higher education staff relayed that the apprehension of teamwork can be such a high barrier that some students have chosen to avoid working in teams, as stated by E01, "Some of these <ref type="bibr">[autistic]</ref> students try to just do the project on their own. And it's not very successful." Student participants discussed a range of team formation experiences: (1) teams assigned by the instructor, (2) class activity for students to form teams, and (3) students formed team without any mediation.</p><p>Five participants expressed stress around team-formation, preferring when teams were assigned by the instructor.</p><p>When forming teams on their own, two students noted that students often grouped based on existing relationships. If they did not know anyone, which was most often the case, then the remaining students chose each other by happenstance. As S01 </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual Comfort and Accountability During Storming</head><p>Within a storming stage, the main challenges that described were articulating their individual comforts and addressing accountability. from stigma, individual comfort, social comfort, and team were values that into balancing tensions between personal and group preferences. Four participants challenges from their inability to articulate their individual comforts to others. Six participants mentioned factors of individual comfort -physical limits, sensory limits, feeling emotionally overwhelmed, desire for -that caused tensions. and what individual comforts a participant wanted articulate was impacted by the identity they wished to establish. For example, one student overwhelmed by her recent transition to college and unable to articulate that stress to her teammates. In another case, the student had limited ability to travel comfortably so team meetings and events explanation. a result, her team members rated her poorly in peer-evaluations and she felt that they interpreted her challenges as laziness or incompetence. students experienced with auditory overload, especially in unstructured group discussions with people talking and the discussion direction. Participants also mentioned that of planning and structure in tension with their personal desire for routine and straight-forward interaction. Another student spoke of a when a team member was completing tasks too to the deadline for the participant's work and rest and forced to wait and work at odd hours.</p><p>and employees some approaches to resolving in the storming stage: personal reflection self-advocacy and communication. resolving measures were and acted upon within the same project, while others used storming phase from prior projects as a learning opportunity for how to approach group projects. Three felt that selfreflection and adaptation was the best way to address They did want their teammates to have to behaviors or them. In these the participants were willing to forgo, work to individual comforts identity to match social conforms and the team identity.</p><p>On the contrary, six discussed power in identity, and for their needs tools for conflict resolution. One student informed their team about communication preferences (e.g.; text based chat) and challenges up-front to prevent later conflicts or to have a point of reference if conflict did arise. In this way, she established her identity entering the Another student said she may disclose autism, and thereby explain her if a conflict arose. times of stress, S04 wanted to convey, online, but a bad day.

For example, anxiety from knowing if a teammate was completing their share of the work in time. In a few instances, participants lost contact completely with who were neither attending class nor responding communications. participants also expressed concerns about their own accountability. This was especially true for participants who experienced periods of not working at their optimal level to stress illness. These concerns raised issues of identity for they worried about whether, and how, to convey this sensitive information to their teammates.</p><p>Social support outside the team helped some students work through the storming stage.

A socio-technical design concept that emerged during our research was a team application. Such an application could be an actor to mediate small and large conflicts around individual comfort, as requesting a break a long meeting actions for when team member misses a deadline. had mixed to such technologies. for techniques were driven by a desire to not feel "othered," to not feel and to two-way communication.

For neurotypical team who may not be aware of this challenge and/or diagnosis, knowing how to communicate effectively may be difficult. Neurodiverse teams benefit from explicit and awareness of social information when they are online and even in-person. For instance, in-person and online tools could help express states or ownership over a work task Helpful features of collaboration, such as asynchronous communication and explicit hand-offs of tasks, could be implemented for interactions <ref type="bibr">(#19, 21, 24)</ref>.</p></div>

The profiles would also be connected to a unifying team profile that would be used for team representation in CSCL, such as the submission team and showing team progress <ref type="bibr">(#13, 28)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Designing for Identity</head><p>We focus on ways that technology support values (e.g., individual comfort) allow users to express values in user profiles. For example, designing for individual comfort means accounting (1) different modalities of communication that accessible to the individual (e.g., images, voice, video, (2) options to choose between asynchronous and synchronous communication for meetings and work; supporting UDL needs, such as (presenter, planner) and (4) work ethic for team matching and task delegation We propose these as profile attributes and personalized user in CSCL and personalization initiatives. to the contextual, intersectional, transitional nature of technology should support self-assessments of personal needs (#1), faceted expressions of identity, to identity and disclosure (#7).</p><p>We call for a Universal approach that accounts for diversity groups individual differences within groups. In a neurodiverse group, disclosure of one's autism is a personal decision. The need for explicit identity (e.g., "autistic") should be a prerequisite for accessing customized support in any environment. of status, students seek visibility and of their preferences and needs they can be supported. Alternative ways to initiate support may the individual access support despite the fear of stigma 25, 27). For example, a person can add an anonymous of "I need to take a break" and the technology suggests this new or adapted task the team workflow.</p><p>students could pin a and weaknesses" column in their profile a team page, which they may tailor to requirements of the project at hand. In that way, autistic students and others can explain their preferences, without disclosing diagnostic label.</p><p>Another key design consideration is to balance individual and team identities. When presenting their work and deliverables outside the team, teams usually present themselves as a collective identity and their as a collective effort. Recent studies suggest that in workplaces, individuals are motivated more to contribute in programs for physical and emotional wellbeing when they are as a part of a larger team rather than participating in the system can support identity and actions taken as a group that develop in norming stage (#13). During the critical stage of team tools provide access to best practices for workflow process and foster team cohesion with fun, team bonding activities. During performing stage, tools can the team to reflect on progress and fine-tune project plans. research could explore concepts collecting and visualizing team progress (#28).</p></div>

Current chat features allow awareness for when a person typing" or has read the conversation. However, most do not provide cues to the sender on processing or wait time, which may be as being ignored. To support paces of communication, tools should include cues to convey that the individual is still active and allow for pauses and repeats communication <ref type="bibr">(#5, 23)</ref>. In face-to-face settings, such wait times may lead to moments of awkward silence and misunderstandings. Using a communication aid to indicate that a person is thinking or wants the information might facilitate mutual understanding.</p><p>Misunderstandings and hidden work occurred due to different working styles, especially when an individual's communication and work differed the team norm. Participants were unsure their teammates when teammates would be done, and be expected of them when the document cycled to their ownership. The often ad-hoc workflow process often involved manual collaboration steps, such as email thread with notices like, "I'm working on it offline 3 pm." Without clear team norms and proactive communication skills, these manual collaboration steps can be forgotten or misunderstood. Additionally, team norms improve with practice, repeated cycles of successful and detailed from experienced collaborators, which are all factors often lacking in student teams. Collaborative systems could add more structured connections between documents and processes (e.g., schedule, steps). Also, systems could give instructors insight into the team's workflow practices to offer advice and share best practices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Designing Support Awareness</head><p>The second principle encourages creating awareness information is shared among collaborators and their constraints. Our research surfaced scenarios in which teams when collaborators' engagement levels and constraints were uncertain. For awareness of each other is not a binary status to only indicate:</p><p>or "busy/away." Related work has investigated workplace use of socially translucent status messages to indicate levels of concentration, time-pressure and disturbance Unlike a work setting, at school, norms are less established regarding time away or even a class. Students expressed a for reassurance about overall enrollment in a project and ongoing status. Student participants wanted to know, and share, more explicit knowledge about their teammate's location, mood, challenges, and intent of engagement. For example, a may technology to indicate a status of "I get to my tasks today because I got called into work." Similarly, these types of technology-mediated expressions status can also helpful when meeting in-person. For example, can be physically present in a meeting but appear to be to their behavior or body Technology-mediated in-person support could explanatory status such as "I'm on my laptop to take meeting notes." cuz I need to leave ten minutes early." (#5). normalize such expressions of limitations and needs, tools should elicit all teammates for level of availability and personal well-being (e.g.; you like your team to know how you are doing?") 27). The system can encourage all to ask for help from others if they need it, such as with a "Need help? Ask your team members for what you need this Such requests can then be relayed to other members are available. were most comfortable when team routines were predictable. To support adapting to changes in routine, such as meeting off-campus, technology could enact module functionality (#4). student could use the to pinpoint the new location on a map, plan necessary commute changes, and request that first teammate to arrive post a location flag.</p><p>to Support Accountability translucent systems support accountability of actions among team members.

Scheduling tools could track if tasks are overdue and then probe the student who has not to or report back on status and issues. could also other students discuss and issues of accountability with support systems (e.g., teaching assistants, peers).

By incorporating the notion of identity into the design of socially translucent systems, technologies can give people control over disclosure and mechanisms to advocate their needs in accessible, respectful, and discrete ways. Our tailored design space for teamwork can be used to explore more socially translucent ideas by stakeholder they are negotiated across team stages. Future research should prototype and evaluate technologies neurodiverse teams refine our design space and design concepts.
