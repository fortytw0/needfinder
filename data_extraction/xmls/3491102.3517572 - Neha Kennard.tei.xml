<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Digital contact tracing is an ICT approach for controlling public health crises. It identifies users' risk of infection based on their healthcare and travel information. In the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries implemented digital contact tracing to contain the coronavirus outbreak. However, the adoption rates vary significantly across different countries. In this study, we investigate Chinese people's adoption of digital contact tracing. We aim at finding the influence of Chinese culture on people's attitudes and behaviors toward the technology. We interviewed 26 Chinese participants and used thematic analysis to interpret the data. Our findings showed that Chinese culture shaped citizens' interactions with the digital contact tracing at multiple levels; driven by the culture, Chinese citizens accepted digital contact tracing and contributed to making digital contact tracing a socio-technical infrastructure of people's daily lives. We also discuss such cultural influences with the growing literature of human infrastructure and crisis informatics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>measurements, especially those supported by information and communication technology (ICT), to cope with risks posed by the pandemic. In this study, we pay particular attention to digital contact tracing, a technology that collects residents' travel history and healthcare data and assesses the residents' risk of infection based on the collected information <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87]</ref>. It therefore can build a network of people who might have contacted a positive case, helping healthcare workers find potential cases and prevent future infection. Digital contact tracing has been used in many countries, like USA, Germany, and China <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>. While the technology has been proved to be effective in controlling the spread of the coronavirus <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, the adoption of it faces challenges. Digital contact tracing tracks users' healthcare and real-time location information, which is private and sensitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. Further, because digital contact tracing tools are implemented by governments, the public oftentimes considers the technology as a symbol of governmental control in the pandemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Therefore, despite the benefits of digital contact tracing, residents generate concerns about the technology and even refuse to use it <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87]</ref>.</p><p>The Chinese government deployed a nationwide contact tracing system in February 2020 <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, and the system covered 1 billion users (about 70 percent of the population) in less than four months <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Given that digital contact tracing has faced resistance from citizens in many other countries like USA and German <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>, we are interested in the surprisingly rapid implementation in China. While we acknowledge that the Chinese government who endowed the digital contact tracing authority and made adopting it compulsory might contribute significantly to the high adoption rate, we show particular interest in Chinese citizens' role in accepting it. In fact, recent HCI research has paid attention to Chinese citizens' roles in dealing with ICTs that are implemented by the government or consistent with the government's agenda <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">104]</ref>. Researchers found that citizens actually acted diversely in the face of such ICTs, showing human agency that comprehends, circumvents, or manipulates the technologies. Therefore, we specified our research question as follows:</p><p>RQ: How did Chinese citizens adopt digital contact tracing in the COVID-19 pandemic?</p><p>We conducted a qualitative study to answer the question. We interviewed 26 Chinese participants who both resided in the mainland of China in the pandemic and had used the technology. We surveyed their experiences with the contact tracing apps. Using inductive thematic analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, we recognized that culture played a significant role in shaping citizens' attitudes toward and practices with digital contact tracing. Further, we found our participants' interactions are highly relevant to the notion of human infrastructure. In HCI, an infrastructure is a large system including socio-technical Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: The entry (left), the application form (middle), and the interface (right) of Health Code on Alipay <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>.</p><p>foundations that enable human activities and the work that sustains and develops the foundations <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>. And human infrastructure is the human part of such infrastructure, foregrounding the organized human labor that makes the infrastructure work <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Our data suggested that, in Chinese citizens' mind, digital contact tracing was a socio-technical infrastructure embedded with Chinese culture. Especially, we found that, because of the Chinese culture, most citizens worked collectively as a human infrastructure to support the contact tracing infrastructure. Therefore, we turned to the notion of human infrastructure to inform the data analysis. In the findings section, we specified citizens' experiences with digital contact tracing as interactions at the national level, the organizational level, and the interpersonal level. Lastly, we discussed the findings with related work on infrastructure studies, culture studies, and crisis informatics.</p><p>Our contributions to the literature are three-fold. 1) We presented how a culturally immersed human infrastructure worked in a crisis context, foregrounding the positive effect of friction in infrastructure. 2) We extend the literature of culture studies in HCI by elaborating the role of Chinese culture in the adoption of large scale ICT infrastructures in China. 3) We report empirical evidence of how people interacted with digital contact tracing in a non-WEIRD context <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">BACKGROUND: DIGITAL CONTACT TRACING IN CHINA</head><p>Contact tracing is an important technique for controlling infectious virus outbreaks. It involves "fundamental activities that involve working with a patient. . . who has been diagnosed with an infectious disease to identify and provide support to people who may have been infected through exposure to the patient <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. "</p><p>In response to the coronavirus outbreak, the Chinese government deployed a nationwide contact tracing system in February 2020 <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. The system is based on a cellphone application called "Health Code." Health Code has many variants: the most popular ones are mini-apps embedded in platform apps like WeChat or Alipay (e.g. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, left); some provinces also provide their own Health Code apps to offer localized services. Despite the variety, the main functions and interfaces of the Health Code apps are highly   <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>) and showing Health Code to checkers (right <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>) similar. At the first time using the app, one needs to submit personal information like name and ID number to verify the person's identity; the app collects the user's healthcare information, like body temperature, and travel history, such as the cities the user has been recently (See Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, middle). Afterward, the app analyzes such information and classifies the user as low-risk, medium-risk, or high-risk (See Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, right) <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>.</p><p>The classification results are color-coded: people in the low-risk category get green codes; residents who are considered mediumrisk will have yellow codes; the codes of high-risk people will turn red. People with green codes are allowed to travel freely to public spaces. If one's code is yellow, the holder needs to get a 7-day quarantine and report health status every day. The code will turn green when the system shows that the holder has been healthy for 7 consecutive days. Users with red codes are also required to take quarantine and make daily reports to the system, and the time for quarantine and daily reports is 14 days (See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>.</p><p>Health Code soon became an indispensable part of residents' life in China. Residents had to present Health Code whenever they need to travel to public spaces. Local authorities set checkpoints and QR codes at the entrance of public spaces, such as gates of buildings and the entrances of railway stations. When residents entered a space, they were required to either present the up-to-date Health Code status to the checkers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, right <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>) or scan the QR code (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, left <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>). Checkers only allowed people with green codes to enter the space. QR codes in checkpoints contained location information, so when people scanned the QR code, their travel history would be automatically recorded by the Health Code system. The Health Code system expanded rapidly, covering 1 billion users in less than four months <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Considering that digital contact tracing in China is a large system that involves technology design and human work, and citizens primarily used digital contact tracing in the forms of cellphone applications (which are generally called Health Code in China), we call such technology Health Code, digital contact tracing, contact tracing system, or contact tracing apps interchangeably in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RELATED WORK 3.1 Human Infrastructure As a Theoretical Lens</head><p>We draw on the conceptualization of human infrastructure to investigate Chinese citizens' interactions with contact tracing apps.</p><p>According to Star and Ruhleder <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> , infrastructure, which has been traditionally understood as the foundation of human activities, is not only physical and technical but also social and relational. In other words, an infrastructure becomes an infrastructure when organized practices are done to successfully make use of it for certain purposes. Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> used human infrastructure to foreground the "the arrangements of organizations and actors that must be brought into alignment in order for work to be accomplished. " Human infrastructure is also considered as the "underlying foundation of a social system constituted by the pattern of relationships of people, through various networks and social arrangements <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>."</p><p>The term human infrastructure emphasizes specific social practices that make an infrastructure work <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. An exemplar is Sambasivan and Smyth's report on a human infrastructure in a rural area in Bangladesh, where the technology part of the communication infrastructure was poor <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. For instance, the internet had very limited coverage in rural Bangladesh, and most residents had no access to the internet. The authors highlighted the human infrastructure which consisted of a large variety of local agents who used their human labor to overcome the defects of the poor technological part of the infrastructure. To get media resources, residents without the internet turned to their social networks; they used Bluetooth to acquire media content from their local friends who could enjoy internet services. The network of local friends, in this sense, constituted a human infrastructure that supported the media consumption of the residents without the internet.</p><p>Human infrastructure provides a specific lens for investigating human interaction with infrastructure. According to Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, in an infrastructure, "people are not grappling with a disembodied and disembedded global (infrastructure), but rather a series of local concerns and arrangements which blend in and can be achieved through a human and technological infrastructure. " Therefore, human infrastructure is not like any traditional organizational structure, distributed team, or personal network. Human infrastructure "achieves collective action not by making (its) relationship to the whole visible but by making it invisible <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. " After investigating the human infrastructure in an ICTD context (the exemplar mentioned above), Sambasivan and Smyth further listed three properties of human infrastructure. 1) Robustness: Human infrastructure is built upon social relationships and trust, so people in the human infrastructure can always switch to available ones for help. 2) Variety: Human infrastructure is formed based on local requirements, so there are non-uniform standards. 3) Low-cost: Human infrastructure's dependence on social relationship determines that sharing and exchanging are primarily (though not mandatorily) reciprocal; social and cultural factors play more important roles than other resources. The notion of human infrastructure has been applied in numerous HCI studies, like healthcare <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85]</ref>, crisis response <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83]</ref>, and accessibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>In addition, scholars have investigated specific interactions with or within infrastructure. In terms of perception, Ramos coined the term infrastructure awareness to refer to "the user's awareness about properties of an infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>." Infrastructure awareness foregrounds the behind-the-scene work of an infrastructure, which is usually invisible <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. The visibility gives users more information of the infrastructure and brings users more sense of control <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. Investigation of human work on an infrastructure identifies how human labor helps the maintenance or expansion of an infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref>. The most representative example is the work of infrastructuring. Infrastructuring refers to infrastructure users' creative work that resolves breakdowns of an infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> or the work that helps the infrastructure be better adopted and utilized by people who are overlooked in the initial design process <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Researchers also pay attention to frictions in infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73]</ref>. Salehi et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> defined friction in infrastructure as "active criticism and negative emotion targeted at a public's progress. " Specifically, friction happens when someone does not act coherently with the community. Further, Korn and Wagenknecht <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> argued that "friction does not just arise from the world's differences in commitment and sentiment. Rather... friction is selectively enacted. " Therefore, friction in infrastructure can also be considered as "a quality of encounters across difference-whereby precisely difference plays a productive role, triggering actions that change the status quo <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref>. "</p><p>We decided to turn to Lee's notion of human infrastructure and related concepts to unpack Chinese citizens' interactions with contact tracing apps. Such decision has two rationales: 1) In the COVID-19 pandemic, any Chinese who needed to travel to public spaces was required to install a contact tracing app and present the status of the app at checkpoints <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. In this sense, the socio-technical contact tracing system can be considered as an infrastructure that supported Chinese citizens' daily lives. 2) The contact tracing infrastructure involved not only technical functions but also human work; the human work that supported the contact tracing infrastructure was highly relevant to the human infrastructure introduced in this section. Based on such reasons, we chose to develop our narrative from a human infrastructure point of view.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Culture Studies in HCI</head><p>We also aim at understanding the cultural influence on Chinese citizens' interactions with contact tracing apps. In Hofstede's definition, culture is "the collective programming of the human mind that distinguishes the members of one human group from those of another <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. " Culture reflects features of a group of people and explains individuals' mental and physical activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>; at the meantime, human behaviors are largely influenced by cultural factors, especially at the group level <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Like personalities that make a person different from others, culture makes one group of people unique to another <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref>. Researchers use culture to understand, investigate, and even navigate human activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>.</p><p>The HCI community has paid growing attention to the cultural influence on human-technology interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">93]</ref>. In this subsection, we summarize the literature exclusively on Chinese culture. One strand of research studies Chinese culture in terms of collectivism. In contrast to individualism which gives precedence to the individual over the state or a social group, collectivism prioritizes the group over the self <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Collectivists, like Chinese people, are more probably to be persuaded by socially-oriented reasons, like social support, compared to individualists who are more probably to be motivated by personal factors, such as self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">101]</ref>.</p><p>The group-oriented nature also impacts Chinese people's attitudes on privacy. According to collectivism, advocating private life is contradictory to being communal <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Therefore, the notion of privacy in China even has connotations of selfishness and cynicism. Thus, compared to individualists, collectivists like Chinese people, have fewer concerns about their private information <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>. Moreover, Chinese people have higher context-awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89]</ref>. They pay more attention to situational information than individualists do <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">96]</ref>. For example, Diamant et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> conducted an experiment that examined how Chinese and American people perceived the factors that influenced collaboration. The experiment result reported that individualists like Americans paid more attention to dispositional factors, such as group members' intelligence, and collectivists like Chinese, were more interested in situational factors, e.g. the relationship between members. Chinese people's grouporiented nature and high context-awareness drive them to be more cooperative in collaboration, actively adapting their styles and behaviors to make accommodations for their partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">90]</ref>. When doing groups tasks, compared to individualist participants, Chinese participants showed more accommodations to partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, giving earlier responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>, and finding more consensus <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. Such collectivistic culture also impacts Chinese people's preference on technology design; HCI scientists point out that compared to Americans, Chinese prefer technology designed with collectivistic features, such as being implicit in communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91]</ref>.</p><p>Another group of studies investigate the influence of Chinese culture from a Confucianism point of view. Confucianism <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> is one of the most influential cultures in East Asia, as it has been maintained and developed as the primary ethical system for East Asians' social interactions for about 2,500 years. Confucianism has five primary virtues <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>: 1) Benevolence (manifesting love and compassion for others); 2) Righteousness (being impartial and just even in front of temptation); 3) Ritual Propriety (respecting the existing social orders); 4) Wisdom (constantly developing knowledge of the world); 5) Trustworthiness (being reliable and honest). Besides the five primary virtues, Confucianism also argues for <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>: 1) Self-discipline (exerting self-control); and 2) Harmony (respecting people's disagreements and avoiding confrontations). Previous researchers have shed light on how Chinese users' experience with technology is embedded with Confucianism <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">92,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">93,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">97,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">101]</ref>. Most research reveals how Confucianism facilitates the technology-mediated interactions between people <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>. Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref> presented that, particularly driven by benevolence and ritual propriety, young Chinese adults intentionally used more accessible social media stickers to facilitate communication with seniors. Confucianism has also been proved to be effective in building trust. Huang and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> reported a study on a Chinese e-Commerce website. The site allowed users to have more personalized choices without breaking the existing e-Commerce system, including encouraging instant private communication with sellers and providing customized options. These choices cultivated a sense of harmony because they show more flexibility to resolve the conflicts between users and sellers. Therefore, users show more trust in the website. That said, Confucianism also leads to negative consequences. Recently, HCI researchers also pay attention to the influence of Confucianism in moderating Chinese people's interactions with ICT-supported government regulations. Kou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> found that the five virtues of Confucianism reconciled Chinese people to the conflicts caused by internet censorship. Moreover, Confucianism could lead to alienation and isolation. Because Confucianism demands a high level of self-discipline, it requires people to neglect inner experience. Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> demonstrated that Chinese people would be labeled as weak-willed if they revealed their mental health problems to the public. The stigma of one person's mental health problems sometimes can even lead to the damage of the reputation of the entire family <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>.</p><p>In this study, we join HCI scholars' research of cultural influences on human-technology interaction. We borrowed the vocabularies from collectivism and Confucianism research (e.g. self-discipline, benevolence, etc.) to pinpoint the specific culture influence on Chinese citizens' interaction with digital contact tracing. More importantly, we contribute to the literature by unpacking the role of culture in the adoption of the digital contact tracing infrastructure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Crisis Informatics and Contact Tracing in the COVID-19 Pandemic</head><p>Lastly, we interpret the residents' interactions with contact tracing apps in the pandemic based on prior work in crisis informatics. Crisis Informatics is "a multidisciplinary field combining computing and social science knowledge of disasters; its central tenet is that people use personal information and social science knowledge to respond to disasters in creative ways to cope with uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. " Crisis informatics scholars are interested in information-driven emergency response, considering it as "an expanded social system where information is disseminated within and between official public channels and entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>." Specifically, Crisis informatics research investigates the information exchange among different parties, such as C2C (citizens to citizens), C2A (citizens to authorities), A2C (authorities to citizens), A2A (authorities to authorities) <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. Crisis informatics researchers have been paying constant attention to public health crises, like the outbreak of the Zika virus <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</p><p>In public health crises, viruses could be transmitted through infected cases to healthy ones. Residents in a virus outbreak, therefore, face huge uncertainty in terms of contacting humans or other vehicles. Researchers are concerned about the extreme uncertainty's impact on residents' seeking, communicating, and curating of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. Gui et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> studied residents' perceptions of the Zika virus through social media discourses. They identified the multidimensionality of residents' risk perceptions: while the temporal dimension includes short and long-term risk perceptions, the scope dimension covers personal and global perceptions. The emerging COVID-19 pandemic, which is one of the most influential public health crises in human history, has drawn intensive attention from crisis informatics researchers since its outbreak. The most recent study of the COVID-19 pandemic listed that, compared to other crises, the COVID-19 pandemic has several characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>: 1) the pandemic impacts all regions in the world; 2) the crisis endangers all populations of human beings; 3) it is extremely difficult to identify or prevent the virus; 4) based on the current status, the outbreak could not be contained shortly; 5) the pandemic is highly embedded in human life and requires people's constant effort of taking preventive measures; 6) the response to the pandemic is driven by various and even conflicting values. In the pandemic, residents faced serious information-related problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">99,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">103]</ref>. For example, researchers had reported misinformation problems in USA, China, and India, where citizens' information seeking was tremendously hindered by coronavirus skeptics, political debates, and censorship, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>.</p><p>Among the studies of the COVID-19 pandemic, one strand of research specifically investigated digital contact tracing <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87]</ref>. Digital contact tracing is a method that leverages ICTs to recognize and alert users who might have contacted positive cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>. It has been proved to be effective in containing the pandemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. However, the controversiality of digital contact tracing, which primarily involves privacy issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, concerns citizens. That said, scholars still discovered factors that could positively influence citizens' acceptance of contact tracing. Some researchers highlighted the importance of human participation in contact tracing. For instance, Lu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> pointed out that, while digital contact tracing could provide better privacy protection and more convenience, human contact tracers made citizens perceive more security and reassurance.</p><p>In the studies of factors that impact residents' adoption of digital contact tracing, some researchers paid particular attention to social or cultural factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81]</ref>. In terms of social influences, Jamieson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> reported that social stigmatization negatively influenced Japanese people's willingness to install digital contact tracing. Speaking of cultural factors, Seberger and Patil <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref> deployed an online experiment. It first tested the social orientation of the participants and then elicited their perceptions and expected use of digital contact tracing. The experiment found that people with collective social orientation were more likely to accept and use digital contact tracing than individualists did. In addition, Utz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref> surveyed the opinions of residents in Germany (N=1003), USA (N=1003), and China (N=1019). The survey result showed that Chinese people's adoption of digital contact tracing and willingness to adopt the technology were significantly higher than Germans' and Americans'. Kim and Kwan <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, after investigating the public's adoption of digital contact tracing in US and South Korea, directly pointed out that people with stronger collectivist orientation had less privacy concerns, and thereby tended to be more willing to adopt digital contact tracing.</p><p>That said, most of research on the adoption of contact tracing applied quantitative methods and asked hypothetical questions about using the technology, and little has been done to qualitatively explore people's attitudes and behaviors in real life <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>. As an exception, Liu and Graham interviewed 38 Chinese people's perception on digital contact tracing <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. This study broadly introduced how Chinese citizens viewed the contact tracing apps in terms of privacy, new algorithmic technology, and implementation of the new technology. But it did not foregrounded the factors behind such perceptions, such as the Chinese culture. We build our research on these investigations and extend the literature by providing a qualitative report on cultural influence on citizens' use of digital contact tracing framed by the notion of human infrastructure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">METHODS</head><p>We took a qualitative approach to answer the research question. We started by observing Chinese people's reactions to digital contact tracing on social media. Since the implementation of the contact tracing system in China in February 2020 <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>, we have frequented Chinese social media platforms such as Weibo, WeChat Moments, and the like. We read official sources as well as observed Chinese netizens' discourses about contact tracing apps. We immersed ourselves in such information. From the observation, we got a basic understanding of contact tracing apps in China (see the background section). Afterwards, we conducted an IRB-approved interview study with 26 Chinese interviewees who had used digital contact tracing in the COVID-19 pandemic. We applied thematic analysis to comprehend the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Interview Protocol</head><p>In this study, we adopted semi-structured interviews as the data collection method. We developed an interview protocol based on our preliminary understanding of Chinese residents' use of contact tracing apps. The questions are listed below:</p><p>• What contact tracing app are you using?</p><p>• How do you use the contact tracing app in your daily life?</p><p>• What do you think about the contact tracing app?</p><p>• What is your comment on contact tracing app in terms of controlling the pandemic? • How does the contact tracing app change your life? • How does contact tracing apps change the life of your family or friends?</p><p>Besides the protocol, we also asked follow-up questions when participants mentioned interesting points like cultural influence. For example, when weighing the individual's privacy concerns against the society's safety in terms of adopting the contact tracing apps, one participant said "definitely the society is the priority," so the participant supported adopting the technology (See P12's quotes in section 5.1.2 for more details). Such examples suggested a significant influence of collectivist culture. Therefore, we encouraged them to elaborate more on the cultural influence on their perceptions of and practices with digital contact taracing.</p><p>To better analyze the interviewees' opinions, we audio-recorded all interviews and transcribed them into text. We started recording after we got the interviewees' consent. In the interviews, participants had the right to refuse to answer any question or to quit the interview.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Participant Recruitment</head><p>Our interviews took place from July to August 2020. We designed a survey for participant recruitment. We aimed at adult Chinese who have used digital contact tracing apps in the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, in the first part of the survey, we asked three screening questions:</p><p>• Did you live in China after the COVID-19 pandemic broke out (January 23rd, 2020)? • Have you used contact tracing apps in China during the COVID-19 pandemic? • Are you 18 years old or older? Survey takers who answered "no" to any of the three questions were filtered out. In the second part, we asked the selected survey takers questions about the demographics, including gender (self-reported without given options), age, education background, residence location, vocation, type of digital contact tracing. In terms of the usage of digital contact tracing, because all Chinese residents were required to install and use it since February, 2020, we did not ask how long they had used the technology. Instead, we surveyed the frequency of using the contact tracing apps to better understand the usage (See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>We applied snowball sampling for participant recruitment. We started recruiting interviewees from the private social network of a member of the research team, who is a native Chinese and currently lives in US. After interviewing people from the network, we asked the interviewees to recommend people who were both eligible and interested in this study. We then sent invitation (including the survey) to the potential participants. We finally recruited 26 interviewees. All interviews were conducted through remote means like WeChat and Skype, because it was difficult for the interviewer to travel and meet interviewees in China in the pandemic.</p><p>The interviews ranged from 20 to 60 minutes (43 minutes on average). We compensated participants for the time they spent in interviews. We paid them 70 CNY (about 10 USD) for every 30 minutes. The interviewees included 11 males and 15 females (selfreported gender). They were averagely 29 years old, ranging from 19 to 57. In terms of education, 16 participants got a bachelor's degree, 9 got a master's degree, and 1 graduated from high school. Among our interviewees, 13 people lived in East China (Shandong, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Fujian), 7 in North China (Beijing, Tianjin), 2 in South Central China (Hubei, Guangdong), 2 in Southwest China (Guizhou, Chongqing), 1 in Northeast China (Jilin), and 1 in Northwest China (Xinjiang). Fifteen of them used contact tracing on WeChat, nine used on Alipay, and two used apps developed by local authorities. Eight participants used digital contact tracing more than once per day, twelve used them 2-6 times per day, and six interviewees used them less than once per week.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Data Analysis</head><p>After we finished the interview sessions, we transcribed the recorded audio files into text documents. We then deployed a thematic analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> to interpret the data. We chose a bottom-up approach for coding. As mentioned in section 4.1, we noticed that participants' perception of digital contact tracing were largely influenced by Chinese culture. For instance, many participants used phrases like "thinking about the big picture," "sacrificing for our country, " "being self-discipline" when they talked about their perceptions of contact tracing apps. We therefore paid particular attention to the cultural influence when coding the data. In other words, when we generated, organized, and refined the codes, we considered the cultural influence as the unit of analysis. We used the vocabularies of collectivism and Confucianism, such as harmony and benevolence, to describe such cultural influence. After we organized all the codes, we noticed that the digital contact tracing was embedded in participants' lives at multiple levels, including national (e.g. state surveillance), organizational (e.g. local regulation), and interpersonal (e.g. everyday social life) levels. The comprehensive influence also suggested that the digital contact tracing was not just a cellphone app for travel advice but rather a socio-technical infrastructure that supported citizens' daily lives. And citizens who are influenced by culture actually contributed to the infrastructure by adopting the technology and helping others adopt it. This reminded us of the concept of human infrastructure, where human factors played an important role in supporting an infrastructure. Therefore, we chose to use human infrastructure as the theoretical lens. Lastly, We formed three themes based on the three levels of interactions. We selected the most representative quotes to illustrate the themes. Because the interviews were all conducted in Chinese, we also translated the quotes into English word by word. That said, we acknowledge that the translation might cause the loss of some nuances of the quotes. We elaborate on the three themes in the findings section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">FINDINGS</head><p>Participants in this study described how they perceived and used digital contact tracing in the pandemic. They shared their lived experiences with the technology. We present the interactions between participants and the technology in the following sections: interactions with digital contact tracing at the national level refer to citizens' perceptions of and behaviors to digital contact tracing as a nationwide policy, reflecting the relationship between citizens and the central government; interactions at the organizational level demonstrate the interactions between subordinates and superordinates mediated by the digital contact tracing in organizational settings; interactions at the interpersonal level shows citizens' daily practices with family members, friends, or strangers that were shaped by the contact tracing technology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Interactions with Digital Contact Tracing at the National Level</head><p>The contact tracing system was introduced by the Chinese government at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. All citizens in China were required to install the apps and report their information to the system if they needed to travel to any public space. In citizens' eyes, the digital contact tracing system represented a nationwide policy. Therefore, when participants talked about the novel technology, they primarily reflected on the relationship between citizens and the government.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Relating Digital Contact Tracing to State Surveillance.</head><p>All participants (26 out of 26) understood that the digital contact tracing was a part of the current surveillance system and they chose to adopt it nonetheless. In the past decades, the Chinese government has implemented a real-name system that covers the entire Chinese Internet for cybersecurity reasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. By the year 2020, when Chinese users register for an account of any cellphone app or online forum, they are required to provide real identity information, like ID numbers or cellphone numbers. Chinese people hence have got used to an online environment monitored by state surveillance <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, where users' information should be collected by authorities. Therefore, when the contact tracing apps, which collected users' travel history and other information, were introduced, citizens were not surprised. P23 said:</p><p>I don't think it's something unexpected. Now everything online requires real name. Our personal information might have been disclosed already. I don't think it's right, it's just normal. Besides, the Health Code is a way by which our country controls the pandemic, it is also an effective way of monitoring citizens. It might invade people's privacy. But I honestly don't much care about this. And I don't have any strong feelings for it. I just feel like, it's there and I cannot avoid it.</p><p>[P23] The existing digital world established a foundation for Chinese citizens before the COVID-19 pandemic began. The foundation included not only the technical foundation where apps and websites are designed to collect user information, but also the cognitive foundation that users should be collected by the apps and websites. The new contact tracing technology was just an extension of the existing surveillance system so that it could be used to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. P23's indifferent feeling echoed what Liu <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> called "privacy fatalism" among Chinese citizens, which refers to an attitude that "privacy concerns are irrelevant because people cannot and will not have privacy in China in the era of Big Data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>" In addition to the technical and cognitive foundation, the existing infrastructure also provided a routine foundation with which the citizens could more easily adopt the contact tracing apps. P1 introduced how he learned to use the new app:</p><p>Interviewer: How did you learn to use Health Code? P1: It's easy, anyone who knows how to scan a QR code knows how to use it (Health Code). Let's say you are using Alipay, you just type in "Health Code" in the searching bar, the Health Code mini program automatically jumps out. You type in your identity information, then it (automatically recognizes you). Actually, you already done that (uploading identity information) before, Alipay already got your information, like your bank account. It then scans your face to verify your identity, then it gives you a code. When you need to use the Health Code, you open Alipay and look for recently used mini programs, then you can see "check your Health Code". Interviewer: Do you have any privacy concerns? P1: It (Health Code) is actually run by the government...basically, all the information is already there, like your payment account information. We do know there could be privacy problems. But Alipay is a big company, it's a trustworthy platform. To make people better adopt digital contact tracing, the government collaborated with giant platforms like WeChat and Alipay <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. These platforms were indispensable in citizens' daily lives, and users felt comfortable to let the platforms have their private information. Therefore, although P1 understood Health Code was run by the government and there could be privacy problems, the trust on the platform alleviated the concerns. Besides, the Health Code was embedded in apps that were popular among most users. Using the apps was a part of citizens' daily routines. Therefore, when the citizens used the Health Code, it was just like using an extension of the apps which they had been using every day. This finding echoed previous research which found out that, when a function is introduced on a platform where users are already familiar with it, the function can be more easily adopted by users <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87]</ref>.</p><p>Although all informants were not surprised by the new digital contact tracing and chose to adopt it, three participants expressed concerns about the technology and associated policies. P21 told us:</p><p>At the beginning, why we used the Health Code thing... it was definitely because that it's compulsory. But there is another layer of meaning of the Health Code, in our mind, the Health Code is like a contract, it's a special and temporary policy in the pandemic, so we support it and use it. Although nobody explicitly said (that it was temporary and special), but I think most of us consider the Health Code in this way. And now it becomes permanent, it feels like it is decided by one side and we do not have the chance to resist it. We accept a contract and now the time of it is extended. In the future, some disease not related to the pandemic will also be taken into consideration, and it would bring discrimination.</p><p>[P21] The installed base, including the technical, cognitive, and routine foundation of using contact tracing apps made the implementation of the apps too easy and too fast. It soon became an infrastructure that everyone had to rely on. The swift expansion of the apps concerned some citizens: If the rapidly growing infrastructure made mistakes, it would be too powerful to changed or resisted. One participant, P26, pointed out that, the emerging digital contact tracing infrastructure could stigmatize people who are not willing to use it. P26, a 21-year-old college student, said:</p><p>I am an individual, and what I am against, the Health Code, is a system. If you stand against it, people around you might think you are uncooperative, you do not obey the order. People think you are strange. Then they show less respect to you, they would judge you instead of thinking about why you resist. You will feel like you are disrespected or your voice is not heard, and then you feel powerless. So usually people would not try this (resist Health Code). [P26] When most people adopted digital contact tracing, resisting it became more than going against the government power. It involves behaving against the majority of the people. This violates Confucianism's ritual propriety, which requires people to respect social orders maintained by the majority <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. P26 was afraid that going against the majority would further bring stigmatization and alienation, so she gave up. It was not only the power of the system but also the pressure created by culture that prevented her from resisting the contact tracing apps. P26's case contradicts a most recent study in Japan <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, which showed that stigmatization prevents citizens from using digital contact tracing because the stigmatization mostly targeted at people who were reported to be infected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.2">Justifying Digital Contact Tracing in the Pandemic</head><p>Context. In addition to accepting digital contact tracing as a part of the state surveillance, most participants (20 out of 26) also interpreted it in the COVID-19 pandemic context, highlighting the necessity of thinking and behaving collectively. Such interpretation justified the digital contact tracing and also contributed to the adoption of it. Some of them emphasized that using contact tracing apps would help the country contain the pandemic, like P22 said:</p><p>Travel history, in any case, is citizens' privacy. But sharing travel history shows a citizen's responsibility to the country, and it is a citizen's obligation to do that. If the information can be protected well, I think it's necessary to record the travel history in the pandemic. For those places where a large volume of people travel in and out, they need the Health Code to make sure all possible people and places are covered. So I think, to a large degree, the Health Code really helps healthcare workers investigate how the virus spreads out. It's beneficial. So even if privacy protection is not guaranteed, I am willing to make the sacrifice to help health workers to stop the pandemic as soon as possible. Anyway my travel history is not so sensitive to me. [P22] P22, underscored that the COVID-19 pandemic was a special time. At a special time, many policies and rules, like privacy and surveillance, need to be renegotiated. The primary tenet of the new policies and rules should be defending the country. Therefore, in the special time, citizens should be willing to make sacrifices, like giving up privacy, to the country. While previous studies find that collectivists are more willing to sacrifice for the group <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref>, P22's opinion points out a specific scenario that triggers the willingness of sacrificing: when the group is in danger and making sacrifice could help to save the group. Participants further justified the collectivistic thoughts in the COVID-19 pandemic. P12 argued:</p><p>Well, I don't know if it's a human right thing or not. I think it should be beneficial to most people. Let's say someone has a red code, you can't say, oh we need to protect his right and we just hide the truth from others and do not require him to get quarantined. Then the patient could infect ten more people, and the ten people then infect a hundred. So actually the "protection" of one person harms more people. This is the way I understand Health Code. Definitely the entire society is the priority.</p><p>[P12] P12 analyzed the situation where someone was tagged by Health Code as "red. " His analysis foregrounded an important characteristic of the pandemic: it was difficult to identify who was infected or not; and failing to quarantine any infected person could lead to the infection of a much bigger group of people. The characteristics of the pandemic forced the citizens to identify and isolate infected or suspicious ones to avoid infection. P22 and P12's rationales show how Chinese people developed detailed and contextual understandings in a crisis and distinguished the pandemic from normal situations, reinforcing prior work on collectivists' high context-awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89]</ref>.</p><p>Lastly, one participant compared the national contact tracing policy in China with approaches in individualistic countries, feeling proud of the collectivistic approach. P2, a 50-year-old teacher, told us how he viewed the implementation of digital contact tracing in USA and China:</p><p>Health code is also a social system thing. As a Chinese citizen, I understand it in this way: Health Code protects citizens' lives, so there is little resistance, we comply with the governments. Then everything became easy, WE controlled the pandemic. You know the policies like lock down and required quarantine we had, right? Citizens support them, because the policies are not an invasion of human rights. It is quite different from the USA, Americans are too free. They do not comply and won't accept things like the Health Code. I think their resistance to government policies is irrational. Look at their country now, they screw things up and nobody knows when the end of the pandemic will come. The resistance against things like Health Code shows the flaw of the American system. [P2]</p><p>Participants like P2 had a very strong awareness of the role that collectivism played in motivating them to adopt the contact tracing apps. P2 made a comparison between USA (one of the biggest individualist countries) and China (one of the biggest collectivist countries): from an individualist perspective, collecting personal information was a violation of an individual's right and it should be resisted; however, from a collectivist point of view, especially in a pandemic, giving up such information facilitated the cooperation between citizens and authorities. P2 further emphasized the sacrifice of Chinese people was not unconditional; people cooperated with the authorities with the expectation that the cooperation could actually contain the pandemic. And China now de facto controlled the pandemic to a certain degree. The result made citizens' believe that the government's decisions were right and in turn made them be more cooperative with authorities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.3">Summary.</head><p>To sum, all participants knew that the emerging digital contact tracing collected personal information and it was controlled by the government. Most of them chose to accept it because they already got used to state surveillance. They also justified the technology by situating it in a pandemic context and argued that sacrificing personal information for the country was necessary, suggesting a strong influence of collectivism. The wide adoption and string cultural influence further created social pressure that prevented people from resisting the technology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Interactions with Digital Contact Tracing at the Organizational Level</head><p>The digital contact tracing was introduced by the central government, but the actual work that implemented the system was conducted by local agents, which mostly manifested as organizations like apartment management. For instance, the management of an apartment is responsible for the area where the apartment occupies. The management should make sure all residents who live in this area install contact tracing apps and collect their travel and health information through the apps regularly. Besides, the management also needs to set checkpoints at the entrances of the area and check the contact tracing app status of anyone who wants to get in the area, including residents and strangers <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>. The local execution of contact tracing policies not only assigned the agents the responsibility but also granted them the power to deal with people. Therefore, in residents' daily lives, using digital contact tracing involves interacting with the local management. P8's story revealed that the apartment management's regulation was problematic. It harassed P8 and made her feel stressed. The problematic regulation even made P8 worry about her privacy. Some participants even showed that, if they failed to obey the agents' directions, they would get harsh punishment. Like P3, a 23-year-old master student who returned to his university in the pandemic said:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.2.1</head><p>We are required to report our body temperature on our school's system three times per day. There are 40 people in our class. So, everyday there will be someone who forgets to report. And the counsellors have the record, so they know who missed the report. They have a list of those people. Every evening they would publicize the names of those people in our chat group and criticize them for missing the report.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[P3]</head><p>Besides the harsh regulation, some participants also perceived technical issues of the contact tracing apps, like P5 said: Some of my colleagues live near the border of two districts, so the location tracking system sometimes makes mistakes. If you live in Shanghai, but you live very near to Jiangsu, then the system might say you have left Shanghai and the code becomes different. It causes big trouble to my colleagues, because they cannot solve it by themselves. They have to talk with the company management, and let the company negotiate with the governments of both Shanghai and Jiangsu. As a consequence, if you have some urgent personal affairs in other cities, you really want to attend, and then you think about the Health Code system, it could make mistakes and bring you trouble. You have to weight two sides, then you'd better decide not to go.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[P5]</head><p>The story of P5's colleagues showed that the core function of the contact tracing apps, which tracks users' location, was sometimes unreliable. Therefore, when the tracking system did not work correctly, users' life and work would be disrupted seriously. Being aware that malfunctions could not be solved by individuals and seeking help from organizations was not easy, P5 and his colleagues chose not to go to places where malfunctions were more likely to occur.</p><p>While most participants were not satisfied with the local management due to the restrictiveness and flaws, one participant, P26, a college student, gave compliment to her counsellor because he treated students benignly and creatively. P26 described:</p><p>At the beginning, the tedious daily report makes people fatigued, and people always forget it. Then the counsellor started to post notices in his WeChat Moments to remind us. You know, the system for daily report is a "cloud platform", so the counsellor sometimes just simply posts a cloud emoji,then we get the point that, oh, we need to go to the cloud platform to do daily reports. Then he deliberately posts memes and jokes about "cloud" to remind you of the "cloud platform. " Now, some students even collect memes and jokes related to cloud and send them to the counsellor. The counsellor would post the memes or jokes and marks that "credit goes to (student who share the memes or jokes).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>It's pretty cool! [P26]</head><p>Knowing that the university regulation over students could be annoying, the counsellor used strategies to reconcile the tension between students and the university. P26 appreciated the efforts that her counselor took to make the tedious routine more interesting. The appreciation of the care from the counselors indicated that, in Chinese people's minds, the benevolence <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">93]</ref> at the organizational level interactions is still necessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.2">Empathizing with the Local Management of Digital</head><p>Contact Tracing. In the face of the mostly problematic local execution of contact tracing policies, participants (15 out of 26), however, showed empathy with the local agents. They thought the problematic execution was due to the work condition but not the agents. P17 said:</p><p>Our country is very serious about the pandemic. A lot of government officials are dismissed from their positions due to that they failed to contain the pandemic. When things become so serious (global pandemic), the authorities can't tolerate any abnormalities. They have to be as restrictive as possible on the policies, and then the street-level staff should work as hard as possible to implement the policies. The determination from top to the bottom makes the public perceive that the Health Code is a critical thing. Then the Health Code also comforts people somehow. [P17] P17 descried how she thought about the current Chinese system: the central government gives orders to local authorities; the local authorities implement the orders. The local authorities comply with the central government unconditionally. Therefore, in the face of an unprecedented public health crisis, although the central government pushed the local authorities so hard to implement the digital contact tracing, the local authorities still tried their best to finish the assignments. The local agents' restrictiveness on regulations indicated their heavy responsibility. It was the local management's labor that supported the contact tracing infrastructure. Moreover, P17 perceived strong commitment from the central government and the local organizations. The contact tracing-led regulations and the penalties on incapable officials were the indicators of the commitment. The harsher the regulation or the penalty was, the greater commitment would be perceived. Such perception generated relief among citizens. P17's induction suggested her high awareness of the socio-political background in the COVID-19 pandemic and her recognition of human infrastructure behind the contact tracing infrastructure. In addition to showing understanding for the local organizations' harsh management, participants also generated positive reflections on the technical flaws of the digital contact tracing regulations. P14 told us: Our school's system, well, actually you can even report fake information. It's does not check the information as I expected. Then, reporting three times per day to such a system, to be honest, I think it's formalistic. But, the formalistic system is necessary, because it is the system that makes people treat the pandemic seriously. Without it, students might do nothing, they would not record temperature everyday and pay less attention to protect themselves from the pandemic. The formalistic system is an alert, it gives us a sense of restriction, like we can't let our guard down before the pandemic is over. So, although the formalistic system might not be the most effective approach, it is better than doing nothing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[P14]</head><p>According to P14, the authorities wanted to use the daily report system to deliver a message; the message was about raising students' awareness of staying healthy and paying attention to body temperature. Although the system had flaws that negatively affected its accuracy, when students got the point of the system, the message of the system was successfully delivered. In other words, in P14's opinion, the value of a system came from how much awareness it raised rather than how accurate the information it provided. P14's understanding of the flawed and formalistic system could also explain how Chinese citizens understood technical malfunctions in P5's case: the malfunction was more like an alert that prevents you from unnecessary travel rather than a reliable tool that helps safe travel.</p><p>Having the belief that the local regulations, no matter they were harsh/flawed or not, was an approach for protecting the entire society, informants chose to cooperate with local agents and overcome the challenges in the citizen-agent cooperation. Some participants stressed the significance of attitudes of cooperation. P7 said: I would not mind if I need to show the Health Code to bus drivers for a lot of times. Well, I think it's their job and my obligation. We have to do that. If everyone is uncooperative, then nobody is able to manage the society. This is a special time, you need to contribute something, something with "Positive Energy. "[P7] "Positive energy" is a buzzword in current China; it describes one's inspirational efforts that make the society better <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[102]</ref>. "Positive energy" echoes Confucianism's argument of exerting selfdiscipline <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Specifically, it praises people who persistently show positive attitudes to any situations. Citing "positive energy," P7 emphasized the importance of being unconditionally cooperative with local agents. Besides, P7's accommodation also indicated the recognition of the work of the human infrastructure. In addition to attitudes, interviewees further pointed out the importance of developing skills in citizen-agent cooperation. P21 demonstrated:</p><p>Definitely, the Health Code system will make mistakes. But I think in many cases you can explain it very well to the security, if you use HUMAN language. For example, you tell the security where you have been, where you have not been, and who you have contacted, just give them enough information,and make your story consistent and logical. They will then understand that the mistake is on the system but not you. Then they accept you and let you in. [P21] P21 used "human language" to emphasize that effective communication between security (or other organization management) and individuals required patience and clarification. Through the appreciation of such social interactions skills, P21 indicated that citizens should develop their skills so that they could handle difficult situations like technology malfunctions. P21's opinion matched Confucianism's virtue of wisdom: a wise one should always develop knowledge to make sense of and solve problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Besides, P7 and P21's description of attitudes and skills illustrated citizens' infrastructuring work when the contact tracing infrastructure could not function well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.2.3</head><p>Summary. As a summary, Chinese citizens encountered local organizations' regulations in terms of using digital contact tracing in their daily lives. Although they complained about the harsh and flawed regulations and hoped for better treatment, participants showed understanding for the local organizations. They empathized with the local agents, acknowledging that the agents were just working as hard as they can to finish the work assigned by the central government. Therefore, participants showed positive attitudes and developed skills to cooperate with the local organizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Interactions with Digital Contact Tracing at the Interpersonal Level</head><p>In addition to reflections at the national and organizational levels, participants also shared how contact tracing shaped their interpersonal level interactions. Interpersonal interactions refer to those social interactions that take place among family members, friends, or strangers. Since citizens had adopted digital contact tracing in their daily lives, the interpersonal interactions were mediated by the emerging technology as well. Participants were aware of the social meanings behind the contact tracing apps, like P8 shared with us:</p><p>When I first used the Health Code, it took me a while to figure it out. But my friend scanned the code very fast. So I asked them for help. I wondered why they could do it so quickly. Then I guessed, they lived in a capital city, a big city, and I lived in a small town and it's somehow underdeveloped. Our situations were different, our identities were different, and we were different. The capital city had a more comprehensive system to contain the pandemic, while my town only required people to take body temperatures. We were laggard and not as careful as they were.</p><p>[P8] In interpersonal interactions, it is common to see people use one aspect of a person to infer other aspects. In the pandemic, contact tracing became a cue for such inference. P8 believed that people's proficiency in using contact tracing apps was correlated with their social background, like their city's system in terms of containing the virus. The higher proficiency indicated a more comprehensive system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1">Shaping Everyday Social</head><p>Life based on Digital Contact Tracing. Nine participants reported how they specifically used contact tracing as an indicator for their social interactions. One important indicator was the color of the contact tracing status. Contact tracing apps assigned people three colors, based on the risks of being infected. According to the contact tracing algorithm, green code means the code holder has very low or no risk of infection; yellow means medium risk; red means high risk. The color-coding design helped agents or security more easily check citizens' status. Meanwhile, some citizens used the colors as a guide for daily social practices. P2, the 50-year-old teacher, said: I stayed at home during the pandemic and never left my apartment, no in-person meetings or parties. I did not see my siblings, and we did not go back home to see our mom. The most important reason is that we are afraid of death. We are afraid of being infected, and we are also afraid of infecting others. And sometimes we need to take a walk around, and we meet our neighbors. We might have a very short conversation, like how's going, right? If I have a green code, then I am confident, because I am healthy, and I am not gonna put you in danger (infect you).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[P2]</head><p>As contact tracing became a part of citizens' lives, the technology also reconstructed social norms. To citizens, having a green code suggested being healthy; more importantly, it suggested that the holder was harmless to others. Before participating in in-person activities, people should make sure they have green codes so that they would not endanger others. Having a green code when meeting someone in-person, in this sense, became a new moral standard in the pandemic. Besides the requirement of showing harmless to others, some also illustrated the necessity of isolating suspicious people. P14 said:</p><p>Well, if someone has a yellow code, at least we won't let him come to our in-person activities, regardless of whether he is misrecognized by the system or not. I also hope he can understand this situation, I would not complain if the yellow code thing happens to me and my friend don't hangout with me...if you think the big picture, you will know I'm right. [P14]</p><p>Citing "the big picture" foregrounded P14's collectivistic perspective of viewing people with yellow codes: if one shows the potential of harming the group, then isolating the person is an impeccable option. He also emphasized that, if the same thing happened to him, he would not complain. Claiming that he would not complain if he were treated in the same way also suggested the influence of Confucianism's self-discipline.</p><p>In addition to colors, participants also reflected on others' practices and attitudes on contact tracing apps. P16 recalled a case where she met one man who was not willing to present contact tracing app status to the security:</p><p>The shopping market was quite restrictive then. There was a guy, he had no Health Code, so the security did not allow him to get in. He quarreled with the security, and said, "I was not ill, why don't you let me in?" Yeah, you can see rude people like this. They do not have Health Code and they still think it's reasonable to get in the market, so they quarrel and argue. I had similar experience, I forgot my phone and the security did not let me in, too. But I did not argue, I just smiled and said, "well, I won't go if I am not allowed." You know, manners. We are citizens, we are not savage. [P16] P16 compared her and the stranger's reactions to the digital contact tracing checker. She used the comparison to show how she judged the stranger. In P16's mind, presenting contact tracing status to security represented a social order in the pandemic, and complying with the order showed one's manners. P16's attitude suggested the impact of Confucianism's ritual propriety (respecting the social hierarchy) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Therefore, she judged the stranger who did not obey the social order. Besides, P16 also emphasized harmony of Confucianism, arguing that people should not confront others. She hence criticized the stranger and considered him as a "savage. " Moreover, the comparison of reactions revealed that P16 valued selfdiscipline and stigmatized people who failed to exert self-discipline, supporting prior work which pointed out that the pursuit of selfdiscipline would lead to stigmatization <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.2">Overcoming Digital Contact Tracing Issues through</head><p>Social Support. Besides using contact tracing as a reference for social interactions, some informants (8 out of 26) reported that they used social support to overcome issues created by digital contact tracing. Contact tracing apps, despite their popularity among most citizens, were still too complex to some people, especially seniors. P14 told us that his mom was not familiar with the new technology:</p><p>My mom made a phone call to me. She wanted to register for a Health Code on WeChat, but she always touched the wrong buttons and kept failing. I can feel that she was really frustrated and depressed. She sounded like, she was questioning herself, like she was too old to use a cellphone. She was angry, cuz there was a new policy she could not understand. People have codes but she did not have one, she can't do it. [P14] P14's mom's reaction to the failure of registering for a Health Code was informative. The negative feelings due to that she could not get the code which everyone already had pointed out the social influence of contact tracing in China: when the majority of the society is using the app, failing to get one means you are abandoned by the time. It also pointed out the infrastructure's inclusion issues: the designers of contact tracing apps ignored low technology literacy populations with designing the nation-wide civic service technology. Participants then actively helped their families to solve the challenges. P22, a 19 years old university student, said:</p><p>My grandma is very old now, she knows how to use smartphones, but her skill is not enough for using Health Code. She also does not have an Alipay account. So last time she called me, asking me how to use Health Code, I tried to tell her on the phone but she still could not figure out. I then called a taxi, I went to her place and helped her got Health Code. Yeah, I noticed that it is quite difficult for aged people to adopt these technologies, they need their families' help. Honestly I feel sorry about my grandma's situation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[P22]</head><p>When her grandma could not use contact tracing, P22 immediately went back to help. She recognized that seniors were not familiar with this new technology. She took helping seniors adopt the technology for granted, considering such behaviors as a form of family care. P22's care for her grandma was consistent with previous reports on Chinese juniors; the juniors actively utilized their technology proficiency to help seniors, showing the virtues of benevolence and propriety <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>. Besides helping family members, some participants mutually helped their colleagues or peers to avoid the punishment from contact tracing management. P7, a college student, said:</p><p>Sometimes I forgot the daily report, my friend would send me a message and remind me to do this, like, hey, you forget the report! Sometimes people see my name in the list (of people who missed daily report), they would tell me to make it up. I was like, oh my god, I screwed it up! I forgot it again! Then I go immediately to make up the report. Yeah, I will do the same thing to my friends, too. We have so many students, not all the students can be always self-disciplined. So, it requires the monitor of teachers and the reminder of friends to make sure everyone obey the regulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[P7]</head><p>As reporting information to the contact tracing system became a routine of daily life, P7 and her classmates considered the daily report as a type of work. They reminded each other so that all of them could finish the work on time and avoid punishment. While failing to do daily report would be criticized as not self-disciplined, they used the reminders as a way of helping each other make up low self-discipline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.3">Summary.</head><p>To summarize, at the interpersonal level, participants were aware of the social meaning behind the digital contact tracing in their daily lives. They used contact tracing apps to guide their social life, based on either the status of the apps or the attitudes towards the apps. They also addressed the problems created by the apps through social support.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DISCUSSION</head><p>In this paper, we presented a digital contact tracing infrastructure and its interaction with Chinese citizens at multiple levels. At each level, Chinese culture, including collectivism and Confucianism, played important roles in shaping citizens' attitudes and behaviors. The cultural influence further helped citizens form a human infrastructure to support the digital contact tracing infrastructure. Based on the findings and prior work, we discuss how the culturally immersed human infrastructure worked in a crisis context and how culture contributed to the adoption of ICT infrastructure in China.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Friction as Indicator: How a Culturally</head><p>Immersed Human Infrastructure Worked in the Pandemic</p><p>In China, as the contact tracing system became an infrastructure on which citizens had to rely for travel activities, citizens and local authorities worked collectively to form a human infrastructure to support the contact tracing infrastructure. Human infrastructure is defined as the organization of human labor that supports an infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. A human infrastructure does not only consist of the practices of people in the infrastructure, it also includes the sociopolitical structure that organizes the people and practices. Therefore, when people's relationship within the human infrastructure becomes intense, frictions emerge. Frictions are the disagreements among stakeholders. Based on our informants' feedback, frictions manifested as technical malfunctions, harsh regulations, and inclusion problems of the digital contact tracing infrastructure. The frictions, as well as the infrastructure, are culturally immersed. Confucianism requires harmonious and smooth social interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">93]</ref>; any confrontations can be considered as frictions in the human infrastructure. When citizens experienced the frictions, their high context awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89]</ref> drove them to think further, digging out the underlying meaning of the frictions. Previous studies discovered that, despite the disruptions it brings, friction creates opportunities for infrastructural improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. From the current interview study, we specifically point out that frictions in human infrastructure can serve as critical indicators that shape risk perceptions in crises. First, friction can be considered as an indicator of the seriousness of the pandemic. As reported by interviewees, after they pondered their unpleasant encounters within the human infrastructure, they noticed that all the frictions were due to the COVID-19 pandemic: the emergent situation required the central government to make decisive decisions; and the local authorities had to push themselves to comply with the central government's orders. The frictions like harsh management of digital contact tracing could be attributed to the heavy pressure and limited resources. Therefore, even without a deep understanding of the coronavirus, citizens with average knowledge were able to get the point that this was a extremely dangerous pandemic and should be treated as serious as possible.</p><p>Second, friction can also be used to indicate the commitment of authorities. Participants did experience frictions with local management and the central government. But they also perceived the heavy pressure that the country was facing on and the hard work that the authorities were doing. They further believed that the frictions was because of the determination of the authorities. Like P17 said, the perception of the commitment enhanced the connection between the authorities and citizens. Citizens in turn chose to comply with authorities' decisions by actively adopting contact tracing apps and obeying the orders.</p><p>Such discoveries add to the literature of risk perception in crisis informatics. Crisis informatics studies have shown that the accuracy of information is a key factor of risk perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. Any ambiguous or uncertain information of a disaster could fail to draw the public's attention and therefore make them be caught off-guard when the disaster happens. In the COVID-19 pandemic, many critical information about the coronavirus is uncertain <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80]</ref>. Even though the information could be transparent, timely, and accurate, the previous information and the recent information could be conflicting with each other. The contradiction could make the public feel confused and even give up listening to authorities' instructions <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. Chinese citizens also faced situations where information about the pandemic was complicated due to the uncertainty of the information about the virus and the rampant misinformation on social media. When getting timely and accurate information about the virus became difficult, citizens turned to other indicators,like the friction in human infrastructure. According to P14 and P5, the malfunction of digital contact tracing was even more informative in terms of alerting the public and urging them to take actions to protect themselves. Besides, the culturally embedded risk perception also echoes a most recent study on culture heuristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>, where the researchers reported that Chinese citizens used culture as a rule of thumb to evaluate information.</p><p>To summarize, our work points out that, in China, despite the inconvenience and errors caused by it, friction in the human infrastructure also played a positive role in shaping citizens' perception of the pandemic. Specifically, friction worked as an indicator that alerted citizens to the danger of the pandemic, and the perceived reliability of friction was even higher than scientific information. Citizens also recognized commitment of the human infrastructure from the frictions, enhancing the relationship between citizens and authorities. Such two perceptions generated by frictions made citizens be willing to adopt digital contact tracing and stay alert. Our discovery points out a direction of investigating the work mechanism of a human infrastructure, especially when it is culturally embedded. It also sheds light on studies of citizens' risk perceptions in high-context cultures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">The Role of Culture in Adopting ICT Infrastructures in China</head><p>Prior studies have investigated the role of Chinese culture in adopting specific technologies, like e-Commerce websites <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. However, little has been done to explore how Chinese culture contributes to the adoption of a nation wide large-scale infrastructure. Using digital contact tracing infrastructure in the COVID-19 pandemic as an example, we argue that culture played a significant role in the adoption of ICT infrastructures in China. Specifically, the culture raised citizens' infrastructure awareness and motivated citizens' infrastructuring work. First, Chinese culture induced the citizens' infrastructure awareness. Hincapie-Ramos pointed out that "infrastructure awareness systems expose infrastructures to perception... providing users with awareness of their properties, motivating their use, and providing feedback on the user interactions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>" The awareness contributed to a sense of control <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref> which further helps the adoption of an infrastructure. Informants reported their awareness of thinking the big picture. More specifically, they spontaneously considered themselves as a part of the human infrastructure. In most studies, human infrastructures are constituted by professionals who are trained to provide services to users. In the face of crises, citizens considered that they have the same roles as the governments because they need to think "the big picture." The collectivistic sense motivated citizens to share the responsibility of containing the pandemic with the government. Interviewees also showed the awareness of thinking for the long term. We turn to the multidimensionality of risk perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> to discuss the influence of Chinese culture on citizens' acknowledgment of the work of human infrastructure in the pandemic. Multidimensionality of risk perception reflects a feature of the public's risk perception: the public's concerns about a crisis include short-and long-term, local and global ones. The multidimensionality suggests the mixed and complex attitudes of citizens when a crisis occurs. While our participants did complain about the short-term inconvenience brought by the contact tracing system, they believed the technology could help in the long run.</p><p>Second, Chinese culture instructed the infrastructuring work. Infrastructuring work is the work that makes an infrastructure work <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. It is an indispensable part of the adoption of infrastructure. Pipek and Wulf <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> stated that an infrastructure breaks down when it reaches the point of infrastructure. In the current study, the point of infrastructure occurred when citizens encountered various incidents where the digital contact tracing infrastructure no longer supported citizens' daily activities. Citizens had to conduct infrastructuring work to fix the infrastructure. One type of work was to maintain social order. In our study, most Chinese participants experienced uncomfortable treatment from local agents. However, such uncomfortable or even harsh treatment did not lead to resistance due to the influence of Confucianism. On the one hand, citizens thought confrontation was rude and not harmonious. On the other hand, they viewed the uncomfortable interactions in a more "positive energy" way; they considered that the harsh treatment was the superordinates' natural reaction when working extremely hard. With such recognition, Chinese people chose to cooperate with the contact tracing checkers. Another type was to include marginalized people. Citizens understood that the infrastructure excluded people who did not have or did not know how to use smartphones. Digital infrastructures built on smartphone apps have been long criticized due to the exclusion of people who were not tech-savvy <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. Most of the people are seniors, whose children are otherwise good at using advanced technologies like smart devices. Out of benevolence or propriety, participants did the work of helping marginalized people, who were usually their parents, use digital contact tracing. The work also accelerated the expansion of the infrastructure, getting more citizens included in the network.</p><p>In addition to raising awareness and motivating work, Chinese culture also had an important role of stigmatization that prevents people from resisting the adoption. When most people had adopted the infrastructure, it created social pressure, especially in a collectivist society, on people who had not adopted it. In our study, we observed the anxiety created by the social pressure among citizens who did not use the contact tracing apps. We also saw people gave up resisting the infrastructure due to the fear of being stigmatized <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[100]</ref>. Collectivism and Confucianism granted social meanings to the infrastructure, and the strong influence of culture behind the infrastructure caused power asymmetry, which finally prevented resistance and contributed to adoption.</p><p>As a summary, culture played an important role in the adoption of digital contact tracing infrastructure in China, including raising infrastructure awareness, motivating infrastructuring work, and preventing resistance. Such insights could help future studies better understand large-scale infrastructure implementation in collectivism or Confucianism contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>This study might have some limitations due to the sampling method. Our data was collected from 26 Chinese residents. The recruitment process was not random: the authors recruited participants from their social network and by recommendation from the participants. The non-random sampling process might influence the generalizability of the results our For example, most of our participants have a high education background, so people with lower education levels might be underrepresented in our project. That said, this study yields insightful findings on Chinese culture's influence on residents' interactions with infrastructure in crises, laying a solid ground for future research.</p><p>In terms of future work, we propose several directions. 1) Future studies can delve into residents' more specific culturally-induced interactions within a human infrastructure. For example, our work revealed that stigmatization, one type of social pressure, contributed to Chinese citizens' adoption of digital contact tracing, contradicting a recent research that reported stigmatization in Japan would prevent residents from doing so <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. The contradiction could be partially explained by the specific context where stigmatization took place. For instance, compared to Japan, the outbreak in China was somehow more effectively controlled because of a series of compulsory regulations, and the possibility of infection was low. Therefore, participants of our study only had concerns of stigmatization due to not being cooperative to the government but did not have the concerns of stigmatization due to being infected by the virus. That said, future research can be done to deeply investigate such contradiction in terms of contextualized stigmatization. 2) Researchers can investigate digital contact tracing oriented human infrastructure in China from a long term perspective. Semaan <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> has pointed out that, during crisis, people modify their social lives through ICTs and therefore create new forms of social arrangements (i.e. new human infrastructure). While in our study we have noticed that participants did use digital contact tracing to shape their social lives, we did not observed new social relationships. One possible explanation is that our interview took place a few months after the implementation of the technology; it was too short for citizens to create a new form of social relationships. Therefore, long-term studies can be conducted in the future to explore the potential new social arrangements among Chinese citizens.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">CONCLUSION</head><p>In the study, we are interested in how Chinese citizens adopted digital contact tracing in the COVID-19 pandemic. We take a qualitative approach to address the question. We interview 26 participants and use thematic analysis to interpret their experiences. Our findings show that in the pandemic, digital contact tracing becomes an infrastructure where citizens have to rely on. It influences participants' lives at multiple levels. Chinese citizens, who are driven by collectivism and Confucianism, form a human infrastructure to support the digital contact tracing infrastructure. Our paper points out a new direction of human infrastructure studies that considers culture as a focal point.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: The three colors of Health Code [95].</figDesc><graphic url="image-2.png" coords="2,340.86,83.68,192.20,147.85" type="bitmap" /></figure>

According to our participants, similar regulations, including requiring people to install, use, and present digital contact tracing, are deployed in many local organizations, like apartment, universities, factories, companies, and so on. Participants recalled their experiences with the organizations and evaluated the local implementation of digital contact tracing. Over half of them (16 out of 26) were not satisfied with the local management. P8 told us her story after she came back from Hubei, the province where the epicenter of the outbreak, Wuhan City, belongs to:</figDesc><table><row><cell>Before I came back to my apartment, I had been to</cell></row><row><cell>Hubei Province. After I was back, the pandemic broke</cell></row><row><cell>out, and the local authorities were looking for people</cell></row><row><cell>who had been to Hubei. So I reported my travel history</cell></row><row><cell>to my apartment management. But after I reported,</cell></row><row><cell>I constantly got phone calls asking me questions. The</cell></row><row><cell>managers came to my house and let me take tests and fill</cell></row><row><cell>in forms. It...made you feel stressed, and it was like you</cell></row><row><cell>were very special. Then they would categorize you as</cell></row><row><cell>people who have been to Wuhan, recorded your identity</cell></row><row><cell>and travel information, and they even publicized the</cell></row><row><cell>information right at the entrance of the building! It is</cell></row><row><cell>not acceptable to me. That's why I am concerned about</cell></row><row><cell>the Health Code. What if the information is disclosed?</cell></row><row><cell>What if people know someone comes from Wuhan and</cell></row><row><cell>then they discriminate against this person?
