<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Humans have long reaped the benefts of natural ecosystems as sources of food, materials, and land, venerating them in traditions and folklore as symbols of knowledge, spirituality, fertility, and life. In addition to providing regulatory services like water and air purifcation, erosion and food control, and nutrient cycling, ecosystems like forests, grasslands, and wetlands support over 80% of the world's biodiversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[136]</ref>. However, the impact of humanled activities has put these carbon sinks under threat of extinction, with over 6.5 million hectares of forests <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and about 3.5 million hectares of grasslands <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref> being destroyed every year by wildfres, deforestation, and overgrazing.</p><p>Agricultural farmlands, on the other hand, face a diferent set of challenges as semi-natural ecosystems and play a crucial role in the ecological restoration agenda <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[105,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">138]</ref>. Although they support human demand for food and resources and act as the main sources of income for a quarter of the world's population <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[136]</ref>, the growing demand for food and resources have put enormous pressure on agricultural development, a process that already sufers from the adverse efects of climatic inconsistencies. As a result, the adoption of unsustainable agricultural practices and land-use patterns has led to deforestation, biodiversity loss, freshwater depletion, and eutrophication of natural water bodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>.</p><p>As these life-supporting ecosystems face impending destruction, advocates of Sustainable HCI (SHCI) have declared it imperative for the HCI community to engage with and respond to concerns that are seemingly external to computing yet profoundly impact human society and human life as we know it <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[112]</ref>. Proponents of SHCI have pushed for tools and systems that are designed with a multispecies focus, where humans are placed in the ecology along with other species and non-human stakeholders. By presenting nonanthropocentric perspectives to interaction design, SHCI defnes a space of possibility for technological interventions that support symbiotic encounters between humans and the natural environment for mutually benefcial ends <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[81]</ref>. Building on this body of work, we conducted a qualitative user study with land managers in both natural and semi-natural ecosystems, and researchers working on diferent facets of ecological restoration to understand how they might perceive and utilize conservation tools and technologies. Realizing that any emerging technology, even that built with non-anthropocentric intents needs human incentives to be adopted, we engage with motivated real-world users to understand how the goals of sustainable HCI can be brought to practical signifcance by aligning them in part to landowner objectives and the economic goals of conservation managers.</p><p>To aid our investigation of how technology could be designed to efectively support restoration eforts, we used a novel bio-inspired tool, the 'e-seed' <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[84]</ref> as a 'research probe' in our study. The purpose of this research probe was to present the interviewee with a tangible example of an intelligent autonomous interface that would contextualize their responses and the resultant conversation. It was meant to spark the interviewee's imagination and elicit creative ideas from them on how or where the technology can be used.</p><p>Developed by <ref type="bibr">Luo et al.</ref>, the e-seed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) is a biomimetic shape-changing interface (research prototype) inspired by the morphology and dispersion abilities of the naturally occurring erodium seed. It is a wood-based payload carrier that harnesses moisture fuctuations in its environment to self-drill and self-anchor in the soil. It comprises a 'tip' that can encapsulate a payload (e.g., seeds, nutrients, microorganisms, etc.), a helical 'body' that can self-drill, and a 'tail' that allows the e-seed to orient itself upright. To optimize the e-seed for diferent payloads and environments, Luo et al. developed a lightweight parametric computational design tool to control the size, shape, curvature, and torsion of the e-seed. Besides planting, e-seeds can also be integrated with miniaturized sensors or biodegradable stimuli-sensitive inks for in-situ detection of key environmental parameters, with the possibility of aerial deployment in difcult or remote locations.</p><p>While discussing limitations of the e-seed and future work, Luo et al. pointed towards the need for additional user-centered research with domain experts to gain insights into the usability and feasibility of e-seeds in highly context-specifc scenarios. In general, informal discussions with environment managers indicate the increasing use of many forms of new technologies in the wilderness, yet the scarcity of empirical research has led to a lack of direct management action <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. For our investigation, the e-seed served as an excellent candidate for the research probe both because of its low environmental footprint and biodegradable nature, as well as its likeliness for adoption by land managers owing to its low cost and potential for scalability.</p><p>Using the e-seed as an investigation probe, we conducted 14 in-depth semi-structured interviews with subject matter experts from agriculture, wildfre management, postfre reforestation, and rangeland management to inform the motivation, application, design, and optimization of sensors and actuators for the wild. Our investigation was guided by four overarching research goals which aimed to: (i) Identify and evaluate the nature and complexity of existing challenges faced by domain experts in the restoration and monitoring of natural and semi-natural ecosystems, (ii) Identify potential application areas and opportunities for technology in alleviating those challenges, (iii) Evaluate the practical feasibility of technology in various ecosystems and potential hurdles in its adoption, and (iv) Identify desirable features and design considerations for successful functional devices and sensor interfaces in natural environments.</p><p>To support our research goals, we thematically analyzed the data from our interviews to arrive at 4 themes, namely, 'Challenges with Current Practices', 'Application Areas', 'Feasibility', and 'Technology Features and Design Considerations'. An understanding of existing challenges in ecological restoration serves as important context for HCI designers to identify user needs and discern opportunities for technological intervention, which will further expand the scope of environment-centric work within HCI. Additionally, familiarity with the economic and regulatory limitations in ecological management will elucidate the constraints afecting the design of technological interventions and determine how they will be received by key decision makers. The last theme consolidates lessons from our fndings in the form of design guidelines that technology designers should follow to be efective in solving a diverse set of environmental problems and setting the solution up for success in terms of scalability and adoption. There are thus two main contributions of this work, derived from our exploratory interviews with subject matter experts:</p><p>• We report a core set of existing challenges, application opportunities, and economic and regulatory hurdles for sensors and actuators in natural and semi-natural ecosystems. • We present design considerations for HCI researchers for building and deploying novel devices and interfaces in nature and discuss implications for future research in ecological restoration.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Sustainable HCI and the Need for a Multidisciplinary Focus</head><p>Recent years have seen a rise in HCI research aimed at improving our understanding of the dynamics between nature and humans to support more sustainable interactions with our environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52,</ref><ref type="bibr">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">83]</ref>. Works in Human-Computer-Biosphere Interaction (HCBI) have aimed to realize the benefts of belonging to nature through 'virtual' and non-invasive interactions, without causing environmental destruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[72]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[73]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[74]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">109]</ref>. The concept of non-anthropocentrism in HCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">124,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">130]</ref> encourages alternate design paradigms that can respond to the environmental crisis and sustain both human and non-human life.

SHCI researchers have also articulated the need for the HCI community to understand the broader ecological, economic, and historical context of sustainable HCI technologies by collaborating with technologists, researchers, practitioners, and sustainability allies in other disciplines to inform the design, operation and adoption of these systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[121]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[122]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[123]</ref>. As an example, Brewer emphasized that SHCI interventions need to be "scalable, sticky, and multidisciplinary to shift from an insular focus on our community to a broad engagement and collaboration with other research communities involved in sustainability research" <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Similarly, Dourish highlighted that it is necessary to "recognize the potential contradictions between the goals of our intervention and the forces that shape their deployment" to assess the potential for HCI interventions in environmental practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Our work aims to advance this goal by involving domain experts, land managers, and real-world users of conservation technologies in discussions around the design of novel tools for restoration. We categorize our contribution within the genre of Formative Studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> in the broader SCHI landscape, that aims to drive design primarily from the needs and opportunities raised by users.</p><p>While there have been numerous attempts to underline user perspectives on conservation practices and challenges in venues outside of CHI <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">101,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">133]</ref>, literature discussing stakeholders' experiences and viewpoints on conservation technology design is sparse in the CHI community. Some works have focused on ethnographic feldwork to highlight design opportunities for interactive systems in agricultural and food production <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">81,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">98]</ref>, and other noteworthy mentions are the qualitative analyses presented by <ref type="bibr">Aoki et al. and Dema et al.</ref>, who explore stakeholders' perspectives on environmental sensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and ecological acoustic monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> respectively to inform design implications for HCI.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHOD 3.1 Participants</head><p>We recruited 14 subject matter experts (SMEs) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) working in natural and semi-natural ecosystems via email for a semi-structured interview on Zoom. The initial set of 10 participants were selected due to their research contributions and professional expertise in their domain, while the other 4 were recruited through snowball sampling, which involved following up on recommendations made by interviewees regarding potential colleagues who may be interested in the study. These SMEs spanned a range of research areas, including wildfre management, postfre restoration and erosion management (8 participants), geospatial remote sensing of natural ecosystems (2 participants), precision farming and agro-tech (2 participants), natural farming (1 participant), and rangeland management (1 participant). Out of 14 participants, 7 were in the public sector (1 emerita), and 7 were from the private sector of their respective felds. All the participants were based and working in North America. Eligible participants were compensated with a $100 gift card.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Semi Structured Interviews</head><p>After obtaining signed non-disclosure agreements and informed consent forms from participants, we conducted and recorded semistructured interviews with them over Zoom. The duration of the interviews ranged from 45 minutes to 90 minutes. The audio transcripts were subsequently anonymized and transcribed in Otter.ai to be qualitatively coded. Each interview began with the motivation behind the study, followed by a short presentation on the e-seeds project that described the functionality, design, and possible applications of the interface. The use of the e-seed as a technology probe helped provoke creative ideas from our interviewees and allowed them to identify new opportunities for technological interventions.</p><p>Even though the e-seed was presented as the primary technology example at the beginning of our study, we encouraged our experts to consider other types of sensory tools and actuators as well in their responses. Following the presentation, each participant was asked to introduce themselves and their feld of research and discuss their initial takeaways and perceptions about the technology.</p><p>We then asked follow-up questions to understand their experiences with current practices and probed them to think about new application opportunities and design features that tools like the e-seed would need to have to better ft in the context of their research. Each interview ended with an examination of the feasibility of eseeds and other technologies intended to be used in natural and semi-natural ecosystems. Although key questions were presented to all participants, the interview structure was fexible. Participants were given space to share their unique experiences with existing technologies and perspectives about the e-seed and other technologies freely, and their individual concerns were refected on and explored by the researchers throughout the interviews.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Qualitative Coding and Thematic Analysis</head><p>To analyze our interview transcripts, we adopted a thematic analysis approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Thematic analysis is a method for analyzing and identifying patterns within qualitative data, with six stages of analysis: familiarization with the overall data, assigning preliminary codes to the raw data, grouping codes to generate themes that capture a more abstract representation of the data, reviewing the coherency of the themes, defning and naming the themes, and fnally producing the report <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[62]</ref>. The qualitative coding was conducted by 3 researchers across the interviews (excluding content related to the initial presentation). First, we jointly developed an initial set of codes based on our research goals outlined in the introduction that described the contexts, applications, and questions discussed in each interview. Selected portions of several interviews (summing to 10.3% of all interview content) were then coded by each researcher and subsequently merged to reach an inter-rater reliability (IRR) goal of 0.80 under the Krippendorf c-alpha binary metric. This iterative process was repeated for each excerpt until the necessary 10% of content was coded by all 3 researchers, at which point an IRR value of 0.79 was met (although when controlling for 2 outlier excerpts, this value reaches 0.84). The remaining interview content was then divided between the 3 researchers to be coded individually. After coding all interviews, the researchers merged codes with similar contexts and usages, as well as deleted unused and merged sparsely used codes, arriving at 64 codes (see supplemental materials for details on the resultant codes). Using iterative afnity diagramming, the researchers jointly subdivided the codes into larger groupings (themes) to reach larger thematic conclusions. In the next section, we describe the themes that emerged from our semi-structured interviews.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">FINDINGS</head><p>Seven key code groups emerged from our initial qualitative analysis of the interview data. The data from three of these code groups ('Challenges with Current Practices', 'Application Areas', and 'Feasibility') informed our frst three research goals of understanding existing challenges faced by environmental managers, identifying opportunities and application areas for technology in alleviating those challenges, and evaluating the feasibility of technology in various ecosystems and potential hurdles in its adoption. Therefore, these code groups were directly transformed into themes. The data from the remaining four code groups (Sensory Capabilities, Seeding Capabilities, Payload Selection and Delivery, and Design Features and Modifcations) supported our research goal of identifying design considerations for functional devices and sensor interfaces in natural environments. Therefore, these code groups were grouped into the larger thematic group of Technology Features and Design Considerations. Ultimately, four broad themes emerged from our iterative analysis namely, 'Challenges with Current Practices', 'Application Areas', 'Feasibility', and 'Technology Features and Design Considerations' (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). We discuss fndings from the frst three themes in this section. The last theme was used to inform the design considerations for novel interfaces in ecological restoration and is presented in Section 5. Due to the nature and versatility of the e-seed carrier as a multifunctional interface that enables both environmental sensing and self-burial of seeds, many participants brought up the use of seeding in landscape revegetation and agriculture, including ways to improve seed germination and plant growth, and considerations around seeding efcacy and seeding timeline. However, for the discussion of the broader implications of technology in restoration ecology, we have only included generalizable results from our learnings around seeding capabilities. To that end, data around seed germination and growth and how seeding timeline and efcacy affects the plant will not be discussed in our fndings. Instead, our primary focus in this code group will be on 'Seed Dispersal', and how lessons from efective dispersal of the e-seed carrier can inform the large-scale dispersal and deployment of intelligent interfaces in the wild.</p><p>Our fndings are organized into three main sections, aligned with the frst three themes that emerged after the qualitative analysis. Specifcally, we discuss (i) Challenges with current practices in land and agricultural management, (ii) Field applications of intelligent systems and interfaces, and (iii) Evaluating the feasibility of technological interventions against stakeholder values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Challenges with Current Practices in Land and Agricultural Management</head><p>Land management refers to the maintenance and restoration of farms, forests, rangeland, or aquatic habitats to ensure their health, biodiversity, and productivity. In our explorations of the challenges encountered by experts in land management, we focused on known issues around biodiversity endangerment, postfre threats and rehabilitation, and keeping ahead of emerging wildfre threats. In the context of farmlands, we investigated growers' concerns around agricultural pollutants and sustainability, weather inconsistencies, and capital-intensive practices. In this section, we present a detailed account of the root causes and nuances of these challenges to identify gaps in existing practices. By understanding these challenges, HCI practitioners can more efectively focus on solving the problems that would impact the individuals working in land and agriculture management the most, and tailor new technology to support real needs on the ground to ensure ecosystem health. Further, by understanding why those challenges occur, technologists can facilitate thoughtful interventions that can prevent us from making mistakes that were made in the past (e.g., the introduction of invasive species that now pose a threat of extinction for many native plants and pollinator species).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Dominance of Invasive</head><p>Plant Species and Biodiversity Degradation. Many experts (P1, P3, P11, P12, P14) stated that invasive or non-native plant species, introduced through a variety of vectors including contaminated nursery stocks, grass seeds, or human migration, outcompete native vegetation for nutrients, degrade any existing or subsequent levels of ecosystem biodiversity, introduce plant pathogens and diseases, and exacerbate natural disasters. We learned that their success over native species is the result of adaptive evolution due to acclimatization to highly competitive environments in their home geographies, which allows them to far more easily cross over from one climate zone to another as compared to native species. Experts (P1, P3) highlighted that past seeding practices involving quick reseeding with invasive plants like ryegrass, kudzu and cheatgrass to stabilize sediment movement after fres was a key factor in the emergence of invasive species in natural ecosystems and their continued spread is primarily triggered by disturbances like wildfres. In trying to address the issue, experts reported that the scarcity and high cost of weed-free seeds and logistical hurdles in herbicide treatment are pressing concerns. One expert (P14) explained the hardships in the bi-annual application of herbicide to rangelands dominated by invasive species, where certifed applicators must use horses to access remote meadows. These challenges point to the need for technology that allows for easier and more efective management of invasive species, as well as tools that can aid the re-establishment of native species in endangered and fre-prone ecosystems like rangelands, as discussed in more detail in section 4.2.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Economic Constraints and Hazards of Postfire Restoration.</head><p>We learnt that postfre revegetation eforts are conducted for one of two reasons -emergency stabilization (i.e., addressing threats to life and property and critical cultural and natural resources in the frst year after a fre) or long-term restoration, which occurs one to three years out to revive damaged land. Additionally, areas that support commercial activities are more likely to be accessible and consequently rehabilitated. The restoration of vegetation in these landscapes is enabled through direct seeding or through seedlings grown in nurseries, and is expensive, risky, and prone to impulsive sediment erosion. The choice between direct seeding and planting of seedlings is contingent on the terrain, scale, environmental factors, and economic factors. For large scale revegetation, aerial seeding is the only viable option, however, most of the seeds (oftentimes up to 80%) either get eaten up by birds or rodents (predation), get blown away or washed of from the site, or dry up before they have had a chance to take root (desiccation). To overcome this, seed application rates are increased by 2-3 times, leading to high costs.</p><p>The alternative to aerial seeding is the use of seedlings (young plants grown in nurseries) which have better chances of establishment, but the labor costs of manual plantation make this process very expensive, and not all land is accessible for manual plantation. Safety of the restoration crew was also brought up, with multiple experts (P1, P11, P13) pointing to the hazardous nature of working on steep slopes and in postfre environments. Burned out stump holes that are still hot, residual fres, weakened trees, rocks, and bogs are major hazards when working in burnt landscapes. Another concern shared by multiple experts (P1, P2, P11, P12, P13) was the control and management of rain-triggered debris fow and landslides after high severity fres on steep slopes. Soil 'hydrophobicity' caused by high burn severity prevents rain from being absorbed into the soil and triggers fast moving sediments, which then endanger humans and wildlife downstream and afect water quality and the health of marine ecosystems. This phenomenon signifcantly constrains the timeline of restoration. As P11 explained, the landscape must be stabilized rapidly or the "frst rain is going to wash half of it into the stream, " adding that the kinetic energy of the raindrops must be absorbed somewhere other than the soil, such as mulch.</p><p>In summary, postfre restoration is ridden with challenges pertaining to accessibility of non-commercialized land, high costs of revegetation, safety hazards in mediating post fre erosion, and protecting important downstream values from the efects of debris fow and landslides. There is tremendous scope for cost-efective technological interventions that allow for rapid reforestation and soil stabilization without putting conservation workers at risk and that enable the monitoring of the workers and their environments to promote hazard safety. Additionally, developing technologies that can provide access to currently hard-to-reach land for restoration activities will also beneft the global restoration ecosystem more broadly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">Deficiencies in</head><p>Wildfire Risk Management Systems. Wildfre early detection and risk management is a growing focus area in disaster management research, especially in wildland-urban interfaces, which is the zone of transition between unoccupied land and human development. Our experts highlighted that wildfre warning announcements aren't always communicated in time, especially for people living of the grid. P10 spoke to the lack of early warning systems catered to homeowners. "I do not know personally of anything for homeowners warning system except for the public warning systems we have. " Another expert (P9) brought up that wildfre prediction models do not have access to real-time or precise geographic data, saying that "they [weather stations] take the data of noontime and they predict the risk of fre at four o'clock and it's based on the weather data, the weather data can be of a distance of more than 200 kms. " These fndings point to the need for real-time, location-specifc early detection tools for remote fre monitoring and warnings in WUIs. In addition to the limitations mentioned around wildfre warning systems, one expert (P11) explained that legislation preventing logging activities in Californian wilderness results in the buildup of fammable fuel in forests, which acts as a precursor to wildfres, eventually leading to huge sums of money being spent on fre management activities. Tools that can inform decisions and reduce labor around prescribed burns would provide signifcant beneft to wildfre risk managers.</p><p>4.1.4 Deterrents to Sustainable Agriculture Management. In seminatural ecosystems like farmlands, the biggest challenges identifed were around the cost of machinery, pollution and land degradation resulting from agricultural practices, and inconsistencies in weather leading to constrained timelines. Farm equipment is exorbitantly expensive and detrimental to soil health, as P5 explained: "One of these things is going to cost a grower at least 500K minimum, a harvest or combine is easily 1M plus they are really hard to maintain, you need specialized people to run them. They're really, really bad on the soil. If you're driving multiple tons over the soil multiple times a year you're compacting it, which is horrible for plant health." P5 also mentioned that the terrain limited what type of equipment could be used in the farms. We learned that the over-application of fertilizers and pesticides in farms occurs through indiscriminate scattering of chemicals across the landscape, which results in runofs into other felds, watersheds, and waterways and lead to algae blooms that kill marine life (P3). Another expert, P8, mentioned that growers are now increasingly skeptical of old practices of applying excessive nitrogen to the felds, realizing that not more than 20-50% gets taken up regardless of the amount applied.</p><p>Experts (P5, P6) raised concerns about rain and other weather events like snowfall disrupting crop planning, leading to constrained agricultural timelines that prevent growers from getting returns on their investments. "So, you can imagine if you have 10,000 acres, and all of a sudden you have two or three days and you have to plant all of them all at once. You just logistically can't do that" (P5). These challenges point to the need for targeted delivery and precision farming tools that increase efciency, ensure viable economic returns, and maintain the health and continued productivity of farmlands and associated downstream ecosystems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Field Applications of Intelligent Systems and Interfaces</head><p>To encourage our experts to envision applications of novel technological aids in their respective areas of work and research, we presented the e-seed prototype as a tangible and unique inspiration to elicit responses. Because of its afordability, scalability, and versatility of applications in autonomous seeding, precise payload delivery, and environmental sensing, this probe was relevant to both natural ecosystems (forests, grasslands, wetlands), and seminatural ecosystems (agriculture, rangelands). Therefore, it allowed us to explore a broader range of environments and present a more holistic set of design implications for HCI in the context of ecological restoration. We identifed opportunities to apply tools like the e-seed in the management of invasive species, the expedition of the post-fre restoration timeline, and in the design of more accurate wildfre risk management systems and precision farming tools.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Management of Invasive Species. Many experts (P3, P4</head><p>) believed that tools like the e-seed could be used to promote the successful establishment of native species as a means of overcoming the dominance of invasive species. One strategy to promote the growth of native species was to use growth-promoting inoculants along with the seeds: "If somehow the seeds were able to carry with them some sort of an enhancement for vigor, I mean, could that e-seed carry a sprouted seed? Maybe the seeds carry a very scarifed seed that's easily [sic] to germinate" (P4). This idea was echoed by other experts too (P1, P11), who suggested the use of native-seed promoting technologies for fre-prone ecosystems, such as steep slopes in the Chaparrals, that are ridden with invasive grasses. We learned that sagebrush was a particularly threatened species in Chaparral ecosystems that is being destroyed rapidly due to fres. "So, if sagebrush can be packaged in a way that increased its seeding success in areas where they want to reestablish sagebrush, that would be great" (P1). Another aspect of using technology to promote native species was the beneft they brought to the local fauna. Destruction of native pollinator-supporting plants like milkweed was identifed as the primary cause for the dwindling populations of native bees and butterfies like the Monarch butterfy. "What you may want to be encouraging is forage for hymenopteran pollinators and native bees, they require certain types of plants to be present that aren't necessarily as aggressive as these invasive species. So maybe your tool could be utilized to mobilize and give a foothold to native species that can support economic, ecological and biodiversity, whether it be fora or fauna" (P4). Most of our experts (P1, P3, P4, P12) favored the application of technology to assist the long-term re-establishment of native species through advantageous augmentation (e.g., seed encapsulation in a growth-promoting nutrient matrix) as opposed to the eradication of invasive plants through herbicides. However, some felt that the problem needed to be solved through a multi-faceted approach that included the targeted application of herbicides to kill invasive species. For example, one participant said, "If they could really target the insecticide or herbicide going where they wanted it to go for a reasonable cost, that would be viewed very favorably. You know, right now they kind of have to almost broadcast it in a lot of cases, and that doesn't necessarily go where they want it" (P10).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Expedited</head><p>Postfire Restoration Timeline and Landscape Monitoring. In our exploration of the applicability of tools like the e-seed in postfre restoration, we identifed opportunities for technology to accelerate the rate of revegetation of burnt areas to bind the soil before weather efects disrupted the stability. One expert elaborated, "In a lot of cases, it's to the beneft of the landscape if it is revegetated quickly because the vegetation itself can sequester a lot of the nutrients that are released in the fre" (P3). E-seeds, or similar technology, could be dispersed on the burnt landscape right after a fre to ensure autonomous seed establishment before the occurrence of weather efects. Another way to allow faster revegetation, as described by P11, could be to "put down some kind of layer that's going to absorb the energy of the incoming rain and break the energy hitting the ground, letting that water distribute and soak in." Other experts (P10, P12) also validated the concept of expedited revegetation, saying that it is not always possible to wait for natural regeneration due to public resource needs and concerns around rainfall-induced debris movement or landslides. To another expert, the concept sounded "intriguing especially for replanting pine trees over really large burn areas where you know, they're never going to get in and plant the trees. Even if the success of the seeds was fairly low, it could still be faster than waiting for natural regeneration" (P1).</p><p>Another application opportunity that stood out to experts was in the enablement of burnt site monitoring prior to reforestation eforts to make informed decisions about warnings and to gauge restoration project success and return on investment. One expert explained the challenges of procuring soil infltration data used to gauge rain thresholds that, when exceeded, could lead to sediment erosion. "We take something called a mini disc infltrometer, it's flled with water, and we put it on the soil, and we measure how long it takes for the water to drain from the graduated cylinder into the soil. One measurement may take as long as an hour, and those are quite variable, so you need like 30-50 observations of those to get a distribution" (P2). This shows that the use of devices and systems that can automate and streamline ecological data collection in postfre landscapes could be very useful. As described by one participant, this could be enabled through aerial imaging through UAVs in combination with ground sensing technology: "We did what we call pre-planting exams in the Cascades prior to sending out a contract planting crew. And, you know, if the site was too dry, we were not going to waste trees out there. So maybe a combination of a drone inventory, and a few soil measurement tools, or some other method for getting the soil moisture could allow you to know whether it was time to plant" (P11).</p><p>As described above, technology interventions that could expedite the regrowth of vegetation in burnt areas through rapid seeding or soil stabilization against rain are highly warranted. The use of environmental monitoring tools such as sensors or UAVs in remote natural landscapes could provide timely information to environmental managers to support rehabilitation eforts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3">Prediction and</head><p>Management of Wildfire Risks. We explored the use of technology in the enablement of wildfre resilience for urban populations, as well as in the management of wildfre risks in wildland-urban interfaces. Specifcally for the former, we saw that many experts were receptive to the idea of using sensor technology to alert populations living fre-prone areas impending wildfre risks. For example, P13 found the concept of using bufer strips of sensors detecting fre-indicative particles around commercial or residential properties to be "very plausible," with the caveat that the technology might only work if the fre is traveling through the ground, as opposed to when it is a crown fre driven by strong winds. In the latter case, sensors may be mounted on trees to achieve the same efect. Another participant highlighted that the concept might be especially intriguing for people in remote areas with limited connectivity: "There's people that live of the grid. I could see a use for it in that situation. And I could see a use maybe in that frame as an early warning. If you could come up with the right thing that says that there was a fre like what they use. . . the cameras and the people watching for smoke sensors. If you had something like that, that might be useful for community safety" (P10).</p><p>Likewise, other participants suggested the use of outdoor sensors in combination with existing fre-suppressing systems to automate fre damage mitigation in WUIs, such as moisture sensors that trigger sprinkler systems for feld rehydration (P9). We learnt that the use of sensors to detect metrics like forest foor moisture and biomass content, fuel load and fuel connectedness, the probability of ignition, as well as the weather conditions like high winds and dry weather could prove to be useful in managing fre risks in WUIs. These sensors can act as additional sources of environmental data that could feed into existing prediction models. One participant also mentioned the use of technological interfaces that could allow for the efective dispersal of fre retardants in fre-prone areas like roadsides. "You could engineer something to mobilize environmentally benign fre retardant, and then put that on to the watershed, specifcally on roadsides. . . on the dry grasses and base of grasses that are most predominantly starting these fres, because in California, the same truth holds that 85% of fres start along roadsides as well" (P4).</p><p>We also found that tools with embedded sensors could enable monitoring of ground conditions like soil temperature and moisture in forests to inform decisions around prescribed fres. "We want to manage a lot of our fres as [a] natural part of the system. And we'd like to see more of the landscape burn to get it into a more resilient and fre-safe condition. But we don't always know when the conditions are exactly right for doing that, and we had something that said, here are the soil conditions, soil moisture conditions, that would be conducive to burning under conditions we would like it to burn on there, " P10 explains. Additionally, one expert suggested that "if you can embed thermal couple and then do prescribed fres and research burns and things like that, and then gather that data that could be really useful in specifcs situations" (P4). Current research shows that such systems are also useful in measuring air quality metrics during fres <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.2.4</head><p>Technology-aided Enhancement of Sustainable Agriculture and Rangeland Management. As discussed before, the high costs and detrimental efects of farm equipment on the soil are signifcant concerns for growers. Our experts envisioned the use of technology in addressing this issue by doing away with expensive machinery and replacing legacy equipment with novel planting tools such as drones. P5 elaborated, "if you wanted to maybe make it more economical to plant you could say, do a drone-based planting using our fancy e-seeds. You could do an initial planting at the beginning of your season then you could continue to fy the drone through your season to monitor your imaging and match it up with your sensors down below and try to have sort of a top and bottom approach to sensing your plants in an interesting way. "</p><p>The use of sensors to enable precision farming and feld homogenization was a popular topic in the discussion about promoting agricultural productivity. learnt that the state-of-the-art in data gathering practices involves shipping soil cores from subsets of locations in plastic bags to labs for nutrient analysis, and using logbooks to manually record satellite-monitored water content and yield metrics sensed by harvesters. Describing the data growers would like to have in the future, one expert indicated the tremendous scope for technological interventions in farmlands: "They would really like a comprehensive map of nutrients and water status of all of their felds. They would love a map of what seed was planted where and the yield from that location on an annual basis. They would also like a log of everything that has been done to those plants over the course of the feld season. So, they basically want comprehensive data on every aspect of their feld operations" (P5). Other experts resonated with the concept of embedding precision sensing technology in the soil to promote higher visibility into crop and feld health. For example, P3 said, "What could be more precise than having a sensor with each and every plant, monitoring roots. . .fnding those corners of your feld where the fertilizers and water are draining out too quickly. If the plants are weaker for some reason, or where there's an infestation, you can get it before there's visible signs of it. " We also heard mentions of olfactory sensors and biological activity sensors to detect microbial activity in the soil, as well as sensors that detect light exposure to plants to further inform pruning decisions and planting density. One expert (P9) highlighted the beneft of the technology for crop insurance underwriting, where data around the planted area in the feld, crop damage and disease, and nitrogen levels are required produce yield maps.</p><p>Many experts working in agriculture brought up the lack of tools that efciently support the delivery of benefcial microorganisms like insect pathogenic nematodes, rhizobium, or fungi in the soil. As explained by P5, insect pathogenic nematodes are benefcial microparasites that kill stubborn and harmful insect pests that feed on plant roots and are an environment-friendly alternative to toxic systemic pesticides. Similarly, growth-promoting bacteria like rhizobium act as a probiotic and have positive associations with the root and assist with nutrient uptake, though their presence in soil systems has been diminishing due to management practices and the addition of pesticides and herbicides. We learnt that a key challenge in sustainable farming is the dearth of delivery mechanisms that allow for efective and precise dispersal of these microorganisms in the soil; "We typically have to go out with a sprayer and spray an entire feld but with technology like yours, potentially that could be a payload that you would put inside. As that degrades, they would then be released into that environment" (P5). Likewise, P8 highlighted the use of technology to deliver benefcial fungal inoculum to restore bacterial balance in the soil and prevent the growth of weeds: "A lot of fungal spores need to be in darkness to thrive. And so, if they're unprotected and applied to the surface, the sun and the UV can hurt them. So, you might have a more efective, benefcial inoculum method in your self-drilling technology" (P8).</p><p>In the context of rangelands, one expert, P13, mentioned that range managers are interested in tools that can help them evaluate 'range readiness, ' which is the defned stage of plant growth where there is enough soil moisture to grow forage for livestock, but not so much that the soil is wet and compactable and prone to trampling damage. Another expert, P14, added that "if we're planning a project and we're going to spend a whole bunch of money to implement a reseeding, it would be really nice to know when that would be most successful based on what times a year does it have that soil moisture that's adequate. And that's the window then we target for implementing and doing those seedings. "</p><p>To summarize, we learned that agricultural ecosystems could beneft signifcantly from technology that allows for more efcient planting mechanisms. Sensory tools could provide useful insights from soil, plant, and feld data to support better decision-making for growers, crop insurance providers, and range managers. Finally, technology that allows for sub-soil nutrient delivery is highly needed and currently lacking in agriculture.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Evaluating the Feasibility of Technological Interventions against Stakeholder Values</head><p>To ground our investigation of technology-assisted restoration in existing politico-economic constraints, we asked our SMEs to discuss limitations that may impact the implementation of novel technology in their domains. In this section, we examine the feasibility of technological interventions against some of these issues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Legislative and Regulatory Factors.</head><p>In our discussions of policy and regulation in ecological restoration, we quickly learnt that the alignment of the technology with the policies of land management agencies is the primary factor infuencing real-world feasibility. For example, many SMEs (P7, P12) brought up concerns around the use of UAVs in monitoring or deploying functional interfaces in nature. "I think it's because they [drones] are obnoxious. And it's the national park and people are supposed to be enjoying nature, right. And it's defnitely harassing to wildlife and really disruptive and I think it interrupts with people's experience. So that's [drones] strictly prohibited but by and large, it's not permitted in most national parks" (P12). Similarly, participants saw the use of technology that dispersed chemicals or biocides in non-controlled settings like wildlands as a major concern. "I have some issues with putting material, high toxicity herbicides out there under non-controlled settings, because what if, let's say, a kid fnds an e-seed, shoves a handful of them into the mouth, then you know that that's going to be a real issue. That's a very heavily regulated arena" (P12). P3 and P11 supported this statement, highlighting similar policies in fre management. "There may be chemical applications out there to prevent fre. But I imagine that there will be some pretty serious environmental and clean water regulations against distributing fre retardant chemical just across the landscape." Therefore, thorough knowledge of new materials, biocidal treatments, and necessary certifcations and permits are crucial to ensure adoption of technological interventions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Cost Considerations.</head><p>The economic feasibility of novel tools and interfaces was one of the most crucial factors determining the adoption of technology in both natural environments and agriculture. We found that for new technology to be seriously considered by land managers, it needed to tangibly demonstrate superior functionality and economic returns compared existing solutions. As P10 explained, "if you can get the cost down to less than what they're spending now, and have better success than they have now, they'll jump all over it. So, a good economic analysis of the pluses and minuses of using a tool like you're talking about would be the thing that puts it over the top." Another expert highlighted that oftentimes, the trade-ofs between costs and success metrics is more nuanced and that there is a willingness to adopt technology with larger upfront costs if it could pay of in the longer run. "We have to make sure that our efort will perpetuate, right? And if you just throw out seeds, you don't necessarily know what's going to actually be established, the efort that you made may come to zero. Whereas the efort that's necessary, yes, boots on the ground is labor intensive and paying these workers and paying the insurance is way more intensive. There's a larger upfront cost. You have to make sure that that might earn out over 150 years versus 30 upfront costs that were a lot cheaper that never were able to establish" (P4). Similar concerns apply to agriculture, where participants (P5, P6, P8) highlighted that growers were extremely moneywise and "pretty good at cost-beneft analysis." One expert described, "From what I've seen, if they see an immediate chance for beneft, they're willing to experiment once or twice to see if they're going to get a payof, just without question. And then if it works, they're going to go all in and invest it" (P5). Therefore, to overcome economic concerns and evaluate technology feasibility, participants underscored the importance of trial data that compared the efcacy, resource demands, and ultimate economic return to existing methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3">Stakeholder Objectives and Land-use Management Policies.</head><p>We found that decisions around technology adoption by landowners is governed frst and foremost by their land use objectives. As P7 explains, "somebody owns the land, whether government or private duty. They may have resource objectives. They may have ecosystem objectives, there's a broad spectrum of things that are going to infuence what they might manage for. So, what they plan will be dictated ultimately by that. And oftentimes there are economic constraints.</p><p>That limits what people do, what they can plan to invest. " For federally owned land, the degree of investment and the type of response are directed by existing policies. For example, in postfre restoration, "to the extent that any federal funds are used depends on whether there's a disaster declaration. Those disaster funds might be earmarked for doing the restoration and paying for the planting" (P11). For restoration projects, the size of the burn is key to deciding whether action is warranted. "In most cases, if it's 100 acres, it's going to have some kind of restoration done. Now, that's for large coniferous forests kinds of events. There's a diferent standard for non-timbered environments and they have a larger threshold point for where they're going to do restoration work" (P11). From this discussion, we inferred that technology has an opportunity to increase the kinds of restoration eforts that are undertaken by federal agencies by reducing the costs of the intervention and lowering the burden on federal funds, allowing for policy modifcations in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Values At Risk as Key Determinants of Restorative Actions.</head><p>Postfre restoration decisions for burnt public lands are based on the rapid assessment and emergency treatment recommendations provided by teams such as the Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER). We learnt that a crucial criterion for determining which recommendations are made is 'Values at Risk' or VAR, which assesses whether stabilization treatments are needed to protect valued downstream resources from immediate fre efects. "If we have a really steep watershed that sits right up a neighborhood down here, then, you know our value at risk is the neighborhood. And we're going to do all kinds of things to try to protect that value at risk. Now, if we're out in the middle of the desert in Nevada, and it's relatively fat and no values at risk. Well, we're probably not going to do anything for emergency stabilization, but we might consider restoration in light of probably grazing and forage for wildlife. would come to you know, what types of uses are on that piece of ground" (P13). This sentiment was echoed by many others (P2, P12, P13, P14), who listed endangered species, public infrastructure like schools and roads, and life-supporting water ecosystems as other examples of VAR, adding that landscapes with downstream VARs are prioritized to receive restoration funding and resources over others. These results highlight how design constraints for technological innovations might be substantially diferent based on their target application. For instance, a higher cost solution might work for protecting VARs if it yields rapid results whereas a low cost, slower solution might work for other areas with no VARS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR NOVEL INTERFACES IN ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION</head><p>In this section, we present a set of design considerations for technology in ecological restoration that emerged from the fourth theme (Technology Features and Design Considerations) derived from the thematic analysis of our interviews. These considerations seek to inspire HCI practitioners looking to design novel technological interfaces (i.e., sensing and actuation tools and systems) for natural environments, with the broader goal of inspiring new work in the feld of SHCI and enabling environmental action.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Combinatorial Approach to Ecological Monitoring</head><p>Our analysis of ecological challenges and examination of technology interventions in various ecosystems reveals that ecological monitoring and management requires detailed information over broad temporal and spatial scales. However, existing technological solutions such as satellite imagery independently to map pre-and post-fre vegetation and soil conditions has proved be less efective and "kind of a mish-mash, and hard to tease apart" (P13). Through our interviews, we found that technology designed for natural ecosystems can beneft from a combinatorial approach to monitoring. By coupling diferent sensory and imaging toolkits together, such as a combination of aerial imagery with groundtruthing, technology designers can enable a more holistic, top-tobottom of environmental impact. Research shows that the integration of multiple technologies increased the dimensionality of data collection eforts in ecological settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">89,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">116]</ref>. For example, system that links in-situ soil sensors with above-the-ground ing systems like UAVs could provide both soil heterogeneity data as well as remote disturbance events to evaluate multiple variables simultaneously and aid decision-making for local stakeholders. Defciencies in de-coupled technological systems were brought up by experts, who said that "sometimes we'll do like a Red Flag Warning. But it's only because the weather conditions are saying that it's gonna be windy. It doesn't mean that the fuels are actually in a condition to burn, they might be wet," adding that "if you could have them [ground sensors] detect even thresholds of moisture, say, you know, it's below 20% fuel moisture, then we know more about [fuel moisture]... that could prove useful" (P10). This implies that a combined analysis of multiple sensory systems can enable sense-making of independently procured data.</p><p>SMEs also brought up the concept of novel visual indicators enabled through advanced biotechnology or materials science that could be combined with existing imaging tools to create high-tech monitoring systems. P3 shed light on one such system, "this is something that the military is doing. They've been designing plants that. . .have unusual performance properties so that when you image them with a spectroscopic imager or satellite, the unusual properties make the plants stand out in a unique kind of way." They further suggested the design of "biotechnology such that you have a plant where if it's growing in certain conditions, you know, low nutrient conditions versus high nutrient or moist conditions versus dry conditions, it's refective properties change and be detected." Such an approach was also demonstrated by Danli et al. through the e-seed, where fuorescent inks on the e-seed were imaged under UV light to indicate the degree of burial <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[84]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Thinking beyond sensors</head><p>We saw that the monitoring of key environmental parameters through sensory devices was crucial to all ecosystems to inform management practices. However, interviews showed that equally important was the need for technology that directly enabled the restoration and rehabilitation of threatened or damaged environmental entities. Many participants (P1, P3, P4, P5, P6, P8, P11, P12) pointed out the need for tools and mechanisms that could support the delivery of a wide variety of payloads in natural environments. Ideas around tools that could facilitate sub-soil delivery of nutrients or microorganisms for agriculture, or that could deploy and aid the establishment of threatened native seeds in grasslands were common across our interviews. Similarly, participants were also intrigued by the idea of enabling stimuli-responsive devices, such as the moisture-responsive coiling of the e-seed, with many of them suggesting modifcations to the design to make it ft better to the of use. "So, if there's a way to maybe trigger these seeds by some other way like something like temperature, you know, contact surface, maybe if you can do that and then really get a jumpstart. So even before the rain happens, you already have the seed banks and they're starting up" (P3).</p><p>These fndings highlight the need for technologists to start thinking beyond monitoring tools, and into novel actuation and delivery mechanisms that could beneft ecosystem managers. Prior research shows that the majority of the work in HCI has focused wireless sensor networks and IoT <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">102]</ref>, with very few exceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[84,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">146]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Designing for Resilience in Large Scale</head><p>Unmanned Deployment</p><p>Our fndings indicate that factors like terrain, elevation, access, and weather efects play a crucial role in informing management practices, given the broad spatial scale of environmental restoration.</p><p>To do away with the challenges with manual deployment in large wildlands and remote areas, UAVs like drones are becoming increasingly popular <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[115]</ref>, though they sufer from payload limitations that afect fight durations <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[89]</ref> and policy restrictions. Additionally, designing sensors and actuators for aerial deployment can be non-trivial. One key design consideration in the development of such interfaces is the delivery mechanism. "There's a fascinating question of how does it [drone] even process that, if you put them [e-seeds] in a bin and they get all jackstrawed [sic], how is it that you can feed it and actually have it come out?" (P11). In such scenarios, compact form factors coupled with custom delivery cartridges built into the UAV devices could prove to be efective. Additional considerations for aerially deployed systems include structural and CHI '22, April 29-May 05, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA mechanical integrity, as brought up by P4, "you have to be concerned with the fragility too, right? If it's in like this constantly agitated tank that sort of constant agitation might damage it. So, they need to be pretty robust." To that efect, protective casings built around the technology, or the use of impact-resilient materials could promote mechanical resilience. We inferred that in unmanned and remote feld-deployment scenarios, technology needs to be sturdy enough to be deployed without failure, and 'smart' enough to enable functionality without active control to overcome feasibility issues. To that aim, selfsustaining systems that enable energy efciency are crucial for successful operation. As one participant mentioned, "where you have fre in a remote area, you are in the middle of nowhere, you have no village, nothing. So, you can't have electrical power, you can't have wireless antennas" (P9). The concept of a fail-safe was raised in the context of the e-seed, where one participant suggested, "I think one idea too is all parts of the e-seed should probably lend towards drilling. For example, the head should be able to drill without the tail. So, if the tail breaks, there's still an opportunity for the head to kind of inch its way down into the crevice, right" (P4), implying that fallback mechanisms that preserve functionality in the event of component failures might be merited in challenging environmental conditions. Additionally, taxing weather efects and unpredictable wildlife behavior could also afect the performance devices. Therefore, answering questions like "what's going to keep the rodents from eating it?" (P11), and "how long would they be able to transmit" (P10) is of utmost importance for technologists to design for environmental resilience. As such, drawing from felds outside of engineering to inform localized and contextual design could be key to enabling durability. "Maybe there's a color, you know, maybe birds eat 100% if you leave it natural white, but they eat 0.1% if you turn it and there's just animal behavior like that" (P8).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Building Flexibility into Design</head><p>The concept of design fexibility was raised by many experts, who believed that when it comes to implementing technology in nature, "there's really not a one size fts all because there are dozens of diferent ecosystems around the planet" (P7), and that "fexibility is a good thing in both in terms of size and scale so you can adapt to diferent situations" (P5). For example, for the e-seed, participants brought up accounting for seed size variations in the design of the self-drilling interface. P6 suggested that the interface needed to "work with diferent kinds of seeds, the are diferent, that where they need to be delivered, the place in the soil will be diferent." Similarly, P8 said that "a tree might be two inches, whereas a lettuce seed might be an eighth of an inch, corn might be an inch. There's a whole span in between and seed depth matters. So, seeds being able to go lower or higher. could have shallow, medium, deep aspects of your technology depending on you know, who you were marketing to. And that might be something you could afect through mechanical changes on your design. Maybe you had a spiral that was a little less intense, and so, once they got going, it didn't go very deep, and you had a spiral that was a little more intense. " Another SME echoed the sentiment, adding that design tools could assist with the implementation of fexible designs "there might be some tailoring involved. And I think with a design tool, you guys should be able to do this relatively easily. . . tailoring to diferent environments and diferent use cases. So, for example, in Florida, the number of cycles needed to drill might have to be changed, just because of the weather down there. So, if there's any of building fexibility into the system, that seems like could be useful" (P5). Through this discussion, we deduce that by expanding existing HCI principles of design fexibility and adaptability to environmental contexts, researchers can design novel interfaces that can be tailored to the needs and working practices of a wide variety of ecosystems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Retroftting to Existing Technology</head><p>While novel interfaces such as the e-seed were perceived as "fancy, " "fascinating," and "intriguing," our interviews revealed that to enable faster, and easier adoption of technology in environmental settings, there is value in leveraging and augmenting existing tools and technology. For example, many experts were concerned about the usability of the e-seed owing to its disconnect with existing equipment. One expert stated, "modern planters work very well with pelleted seeds, which are almost completely uniform, and they're spheres. Your seed is not a sphere. So, it would be challenging to adapt to that system" (P5). Another participant brought up similar concerns with crop management. "When you use mechanization for the future, for forest or for crops, you need to consider that they need to be straight in line. Because otherwise when the tractors or other implements go to the feld, it can be difcult to go through the system if they are not in line" (P6).</p><p>We also learned that not all stakeholders in ecological management are early adopters. As an example, we saw that while drones could enable more efcient planting and monitoring capabilities for agriculture, many "growers are not comfortable with drones. They don't think they can get a drone; they can't drive it. So, the learning curve is greater on that" (P5). In such scenarios, designs that enable 'retrofttability' with legacy technology can allow for more seamless integration and adoption by conservative users. Specifc to e-seed dispersal, one expert highlighted, "right now farms already have pretty old-established feeding protocols, and equipment and machinery. So, I could see them [e-seeds] being distributed in the same way" (P3). Similarly, P6 mentioned, "The other way that you can do this and it's much more common here is just tractors with specifc implement on the back that release the seeds on the correct place.

Many HCI researchers have developed novel bio-inspired interfaces and materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">111,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b143">144]</ref> to facilitate smart, controllable, and high-performance tools for a variety of applications. Through our interviews, we found that autonomous technology for environmental applications can beneft greatly from the principles of biomimetic design. In postfre scenarios, many participants urged us to "look to nature to see how they're doing it in diferent fre-adapted habitats and emulate those processes, " adding that "this has to be scalable. So, in your endeavors, corral some sort of evolutionary option and essentially splice it into a system that it might be efective (P7). Indeed, research shows that seeking design inspiration from naturally occurring forms, processes, and mechanisms could allow for resource-efcient, adaptable, fault-tolerant, and scalable devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[120]</ref>.</p><p>Participants also alluded to biomimicry in the context of biodiversity management, with one expert (P12) highlighting the "really brilliant evolutionary strategy" of the erodium seed, that the e-seed is inspired by. Another expert described the features of invasive species that could be mimicked in the e-seed and similar interfaces to allow them to efectively re-establish native plants: "And I think these, the seeds of these [invasive] plants are actually kind of similar to what you're designing here. Instead of spirals, they're very sticky and spiky and have little hooks that kind of work their way in very fast. So, I was thinking that if you have a way to apply native seeds and allow them to outcompete the invasive species that typically grow back faster, then that would be one way to address the invasive species problems without having to shoot poison into the soil" (P3).</p><p>Finally, experts were about the application of "biomimetic technology for underwater establishment of seagrass or. . . seeds of like cattails in an aquatic system" (P4). While they acknowledged the challenges associated with casting seeds underwater, there was signifcant interest in exploring technologies already seen in nature to revive marine ecosystems. As such, applying bio-inspired research to the design of novel interactive devices ofers the potential for innovative ecological management guided by evolutionary principles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.7">Biodegradability</head><p>No discussion pertaining to SHCI design is complete without a discussion of the environmental impacts of the technology in question. Unsurprisingly, concerns about the biodegradability of tools and interfaces deployed in natural environments were common across our interviews. One expert noted, "you couldn't make them out of like some sort of plastic because the polymer. . .it would be just dispersing garbage and people would shut it down quickly. So, it had to be something that is biodegradable and easily absorbed by the water system" (P4). Correspondingly, another expert commented, "I would be interested in an ecologist's view about what these e-seeds are made of. And then if these have electronics them, then that worries me a little bit is that there's now this foreign substance that if it does get eroded and goes into stream, how does it afect the ecology downstream" (P2). One participant brought up concerns around the recovery widespread electronic components, saying that deploy-"artifcial or electronic components into the landscape that might never be recovered" can be detrimental to marine ecosystems. "And now we have all these tiny components foating in the water and the fsh are eating it and it's kind of contributing to the microplastics" (P3).</p><p>The concerns highlighted by our experts indicate that biodegradability is a core design consideration when building devices for feld applications in nature. Alternately, interfaces designed for 'bioresorbability', or in situ degradation under ambient conditions were received positively by ecologists. "They could drill in, and if that were biodegradable, yeah, that that would work really, really well" (P5). As such, drawing from research around biodegradable and bioresorbable sensors and actuators to promote 'electronic-free' interface designs could prove valuable for future interventions in this space <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">106,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">117,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">119]</ref>. Additionally, designing for mechanisms to efectively remove and recover non-degradable materials from the landscape would be of high value in the sustainable design of novel devices for ecological management.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DISCUSSION 6.1 Engaging Diverse Stakeholders in All</head><p>Stages of the Design Process</p><p>Our explorations revealed that ecological restoration is a dynamic, complex, and nuanced process requiring the involvement of multiple stakeholders, including experts and scientists, government land managers, as well as the human and non-human communities impacted. For example, in postfre assessment and restoration planning, many participants explained how ecologists with unique expertise come together to evaluate the efects of a wildfre. They also described how various agencies like USGS Landslide Hazards, BAER (Burnt Area Emergency Response), WERT (Watershed Emergency Response Team) and their partners like the National Weather Service come together to inform management action in postfre scenarios. Additionally, we saw that diverse stakeholder communities may have diverse objectives and 'values at risk' they wish to protect, and the convergence of these goals ultimately determines resource allocations, the and degree of action implemented. Information from stakeholders allows us to create a precise constraint space that considers all aspects of a solution, and more importantly, can provide insights into how a solution might succeed fail in actual practice. For instance, a designer may create the perfect solution for drone-based monitoring, but if drones are prohibited in the in question, the solution will fail catastrophically in its implementation. In this scenario, engaging with stakeholders initially could either stop the design efort or plant the seeds for policy reform that would enable the technology in the longer run. As indicated by our fndings, uninformed management actions and restoration practices such as the use of quick-growing invasive species can have unforeseen, and often detrimental environmental efects. This highlights the need for additional technologically enabled data gathering and analysis that might prevent such uninformed practices in the future, and points to the value of engaging stakeholders early in the planning process to collect the right kinds of data and ensure prudent technology design. Engaging stakeholders during the design of the technology is equally important, to ensure relevance and usefulness of the data being collected or mechanisms being implemented to the ecosystem <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">98]</ref>, as well as to gather inputs that designers may not come up with independently or that are not intuitive to a typical HCI researcher. Finally, stakeholder engagement is crucial to the evaluation of the interface being created, not only to validate usability in the present but also to factor in the uncertainty of its future context of use <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[114]</ref>.</p><p>The HCI toolbox is profuse with techniques that allow the engagement and involvement of users, ecosystem stakeholders, and impacted non-scientifc communities throughout the design process, ranging from contextual inquiry and interviews to participatory design and citizen sensing frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">113]</ref>. As such, drawing from existing methods and value-sensitive approaches for design <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[134,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">145]</ref>, as well as exploring decision-making guidelines specifc to environmental action <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">137]</ref>, can beneft both the stakeholders vested in ecological restoration as well as the HCI and SHCI communities as a whole.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">The Evolving Ethics of Restoration Ecology: Enabling Resilient Ecosystems</head><p>The role of humans in nature remains a highly contested topic when it comes to the ethics of restoration, which goes into the heart of the debate of 'why should nature be restored', nature can ever be restored', 'whether restored nature is merely an expression of anthropocentrism' <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">85]</ref>. Adding to the complexity of the debate is the challenge of how ecological restoration is defned <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[88]</ref>, and whether it should aim to recreate specifc historical reference conditions, or instead underscore the health and sustenance of the ecosystem, regardless of its resemblance to the past. Recent literature reveals that traditional models of reconstructing ecosystems to their historical state are challenged by the growing plurality of heterogeneous, rapidly transforming landscapes, representing a hybrid matrix of urban infrastructure and ecological processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">61]</ref>. These hybrid landscapes, coupled with climate change, alter the context of restoration and encourage new paradigms that are focused on ecological citizenship and constructive human-nature relationships <ref type="bibr">[78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">79]</ref>. Another factor contributing to the shift from traditional restoration models is the growing importance of disturbances in natural ecosystems; "these disturbances are very, very important to actually get what's called edge efects, creating mosaics on the landscape. And these mosaics allow for optimal biodiversity" (P7). P7 underscored the importance of building 'resilience' into ecosystems, or the ability to resist change or recover from disturbance in a way preserves the essence of a system's structure and function <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b131">131]</ref>. "We have a tendency as humans to see trees as the ultimate goal to combat climate change or whatever the case. . . that's not necessarily good because it's a mono crop in a sense, right? it reduces overall diversity in terms of plant and also wildlife. We need to see the system as a whole, that we are interacting with a system that very dynamic and constantly changing and carving out landscapes and creating diferent tiers of growth. Our goal should be optimal biodiversity and ecological resilience" (P7). To that aim, we advocate technology-mediated restoration should take ecological history and context into account and build on the resilience theory to promote resistance and persistence of key environmental entities and aid post-disturbance recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">95,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">104]</ref>.</p><p>By grounding our analysis and resultant design considerations in the economic and political realities of mission-driven conservation and agricultural managers, we also underscore the importance of aligning conservation technology design with the values and limitations of its users. Past research reveals that designs that aim towards a theoretically ideal system without the support of legal or social entities is likely to receive pushback <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[94]</ref>. With the understanding that non-anthropocentric design doesn't necessarily negate human perspectives, instead places them alongside other non-human stakeholders in the environment, we advocate the design of thoughtful yet pragmatic interventions that can help sustain ecosystem services for humans and non-humans alike, nurture symbiotic human-nature relationships, promote ecological citizenship [78], and in turn, allow humans to develop an appreciation for coexisting non-human entities. Overall, the historical, social, ethical, and philosophical aspects of restoration ecology discussed in this work ofer opportunities to refect on and explore human relationships with nature more generally and provide an important context and moral foundation to technology designers in which to ground intervention design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Limitations</head><p>This study is an initial step toward understanding user-specifc desiderata pertaining to the use of novel technological interfaces in the management of natural and semi-natural ecosystems, and specifically how their needs, policies, and attitudes might afect the design of such interfaces. However, this work is by no means an extensive review of existing practices and requirements of all ecosystems, and therefore, is necessarily limited in scope and coverage. For example, much of our study focused on terrestrial ecosystems and did not comprehensively describe the management practices and opportunities for marine or deep-sea ecosystems <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">115]</ref>. Additionally, we saw that while participants came up with many useful variations of technologies that weren't initially presented by the researchers, they also often referenced the e-seeds interface when envisioning new technology applications. As such, while the use of the e-seed probe was a great catalyst for discussion and sparked more creative thought, having multiple or more diverse technology examples have expanded the scope the answers from the SMEs. Finally, this study the perceptions of experts centered around North America, and therefore is not representative the practices or challenges of other geographical or political entities. Nonetheless, we recommend that future works in SHCI build on the considerations raised by our and them other ecosystems, geographies, and technology domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we presented the results of 14 semi-structured interviews with subject matter experts across a range of environmental land use and agricultural domains, resulting in a core set of existing challenges, application opportunities, and economic and regulatory hurdles for technology in natural and semi-natural ecosystems through 3 emergent themes: 'Challenges with Current Practices', 'Application Areas', and 'Feasibility'. Finally, we presented our fourth theme around 'Technology Features and Design Considerations' for HCI researchers to inform the design of novel devices in nature and discussed implications for future research in ecological restoration. This work contributes to the emerging intersection of HCI, sustainability, and environmental conservation. Through this study, we illustrate the needs of land managers, ecologists, and growers and describe their values and constraints to help the HCI community interact efectively with prospective of their technology and to illuminate the context in which technologies will be received. we found that several design opportunities and considerations emerged from our discussions, they collectively emphasized a broader focus on drawing technology, stakeholders, landscape mosaics, and widescale socioeconomic structures into systemic relation, as opposed to device-level interventions in selective environmental settings. We encourage continued discourse about the role of humans in nature, and the directions that must be pursued to help technologists engage more deeply with the complex, dynamic and nuanced concept of environmental restoration and build resilient ecosystems undeterred by climate change. Ultimately, our research inspires future eforts in the service of producing more viable human-nature interaction.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (a) E-seeds [84] connected to a central hub (b) Potential functionalities that can be enabled by the e-seed.
